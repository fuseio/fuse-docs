## Instant Finality

Most blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, use probabilistic finality. This means that transactions are not changeable until a certain number of blocks are confirmed, which can take a few minutes. Fuse Network uses zero-knowledge technology to reach deterministic conclusion. On Fuse, transactions are finalized as soon as they are verified, making the process safer and faster with near-instant transaction confirmation.

## Asynchronous Transaction Processing

Because everyone needs to agree on the world state, traditional blockchain networks often need synchronous validation, which slows things down and makes them less scalable. Fuse Networkâ€™s modular architecture can handle transactions asynchronously, increasing throughput. This method offers great speed and scalability, even when the network is very busy, which makes it perfect for business and commerce applications.

## Efficient data transfer

A lot of blockchains, like Ethereum, have problems with data bloat, which makes storage needs go up and working times go down. On Fuse Network nodes easily verify transactions without having to store the whole blockchain, streamlining the way the blockchain handles data. This increases throughput and lowers the resource needs of nodes, improving user experience.

## Stable Economy

Fuse Network uses a long-term economic plan that makes the most of transaction fees. The network uses a deflationary method to keep costs low. A subscription-based model allows businesses to plan their costs, creating a sustainable and stable ecosystem. Businesses that use Fuse for their blockchain needs can achieve mainstream scalability with no upfront investments or expensive hardware upgrades.

## Developer-focused

Businesses can enter and build for Web3 in a safe, unified, and scalable hub for enterprises and developers. The network's modular design integrates with a wide range of platforms and protocols. Built-in development tools and zk proofs create a new standard in interoperability, scalability and security with a familiar interface powered by the FUSE token.
