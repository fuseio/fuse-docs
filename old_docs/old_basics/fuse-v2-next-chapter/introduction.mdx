# Introduction

Until today, the development of Fuse as a payment-focused blockchain platform has primarily relied on the infrastructure (middleware stack) created by Fuse Labs.&#x20;

While that was sufficient to carry us quite far, priming Fuse for mass business and consumer adoption requires that the infrastructure on top of the Fuse Network blockchain become more robust and decentralized.&#x20;

The Fuse Network blockchain must also change and offload most transactions to the execution layer. Hence, the transition to Fuse V2 will involve the following main components:

1\) The introduction of Power Validators, or providers incentivized on-chain to verifiably provide certain essential middleware services at a certain quality level.

2\) Adding a zero-knowledge proof-based execution layer to enable private transactions and boost scalability.

3\) The move to a new consensus mechanism for the Fuse Network blockchain.
