# How to Unjail Your Validator Node

## **Prerequisites**

* Make sure your validator node is back to online
* Make sure your validator node is fully synced

## **Instructions**

1. Go to the [Proxy Consensus Smart Contract](https://explorer.fuse.io/address/0x3014ca10b91cb3D0AD85fEf7A3Cb95BCAc9c0f79?tab=write_proxy#address-tabs). 
2. Connect to the Smart Contract with your Validator MetaMask address.
3. Call the `unJail` function. It is a `write` function.
4. This will move the node to the pending list and it will be released at the start of the next cycle.
