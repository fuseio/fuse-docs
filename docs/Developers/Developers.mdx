## ﻿Building On Fuse

Fuse is a powerful and cost-effective platform that is ideal for building blockchain-powered applications of all kinds. No matter what your use case, the Fuse ecosystem has the functionality you need and all the tools required to make it a reality.

FuseBox provides a means of getting set up with a wallet and interacting with the Fuse blockchain without the need to make direct RPC calls, eliminating the need to use a node service provider. Our SDK and APIs make connecting your application to the blockchain and making transactions of all types simple. If you come from a Web2 background, you may find these tools particularly useful.

If you’re a Web3 developer writing smart contracts and building fully decentralized applications (dApps), which live entirely on the blockchain, then Fuse supports all of the tooling you’d expect to streamline your work.

Fuse’s Charge is a no-code platform designed for merchants and businesses who want to accept crypto payments.
