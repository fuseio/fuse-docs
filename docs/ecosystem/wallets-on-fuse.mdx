Crypto wallets are designed to store your private key, keeping your crypto accessible at all times. They also allow you to send, receive, and spend cryptocurrencies.

Unlike a normal wallet, which can hold actual cash, crypto wallets technically donâ€™t store your crypto. Your holdings live on the blockchain, but can only be accessed using a private key. Your keys prove your ownership of your digital money and allow you to make transactions. If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your money.

With Volt App, users can manage their cryptocurrency portfolios, link multiple wallets to the app, and send and receive tokens with the power of the Fuse network.
