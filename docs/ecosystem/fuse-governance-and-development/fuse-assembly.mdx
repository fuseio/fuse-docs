# Fuse Assembly

Fuse Assembly is the first step in transitioning full governance and ownership over the Fuse platform to the community. &#x20;

Fuse Assembly consists of five Fuse ecosystem members independent from Fuse Foundation who have shown consistent dedication and commitment to the project and already have a voice within the community.

Fuse Assembly's **current role includes the following**:&#x20;

* taking over control of the [Fuse Forum](https://forum.fuse.io/) community discussion platform;
* implementing the Snapshot voting mechanism on Fuse; and
* promoting ecosystem growth.&#x20;
