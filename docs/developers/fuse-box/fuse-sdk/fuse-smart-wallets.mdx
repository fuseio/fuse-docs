# Fuse Smart Wallets

### **What are Smart Wallets?**

Smart Wallets are smart contract wallets that allow users to manage and interact with their assets in client applications seamlessly. The Fuse Wallet SDK provides a simple and secure way to create and manage Smart Wallets, which are non-custodial accounts that provide added security compared to externally owned accounts with a single private key.

#### **Features of Smart Wallets**

The Fuse Smart Wallets created using the Fuse Wallet SDK come with various features that make them easy and convenient. These features include:

* Non-custodial: Smart Wallets are non-custodial, which means that users always have complete control over their assets. No one else can control or access the funds in the wallet.
* Personally signed message (EIP-191): Smart Wallets are created using personally signed messages, which follow the EIP-191 standard. This ensures that the wallet is unique to the user who created it and provided an added security layer.
* Deposits and withdrawals: Users can deposit funds into their Smart Wallets and withdraw them whenever they choose.
* ERC20 and ERC721 tokens: Smart Wallets support ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, meaning that users can easily manage and interact with their Ethereum-based assets.
* Interaction with arbitrary smart contracts: Users can interact with any smart contract on the Fuse network using their Smart Wallets, making participating in decentralized applications and services easy.
