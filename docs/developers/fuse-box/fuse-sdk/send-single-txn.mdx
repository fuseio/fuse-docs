### Send single transaction

Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Fuse network. The simplest transaction is transferring Fuse Tokens from one account to another. To carry out a transaction using the FuseBox JS SDK, the **`callContract()`** method is used.

The **`callContract()`** method takes in 3 arguments: `to`, `value` and `data`.

```javascript
callContract(to, value, data);
```

|   Param   | Type       | Status     | Description                                      |
| :-------: | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
|  **to**   | _address_  | _required_ | The address where the user want to send Tokens.  |
| **value** | _number_   | _required_ | The amount of Tokens the user is sending         |
| **data**  | _Function_ |            | Encoded Function Data for Smart Contract Methods |

Example: **`index.ts`**

```typescript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { FuseSDK } from "@fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk";

const main = async () => {
  const credentials = new ethers.Wallet("PRIVATE_KEY" as string);
  const publicApiKey = "pk_wEP0gTlc3jcvBXEDpSnXBgbQ" as string;
  const fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(publicApiKey, credentials);

  console.log(`Sender Address is ${fuseSDK.wallet.getSender()}`);

  const to = "0xb6e4fa6ff2873480590c68d9aa991e5bb14dbf03";
  const value = ethers.utils.parseEther("0.001");
  const data = Uint8Array.from([]);
  console.log(data);
  const res = await fuseSDK.callContract(to, value, data);

  console.log(`UserOpHash: ${res?.userOpHash}`);
  console.log("Waiting for transaction...");

  const receipt = await res?.wait();
  console.log("Transaction Hash:", receipt?.transactionHash);
};

main();
```
