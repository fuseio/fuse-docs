### Initialization

The `init` method is a fundamental feature of the Fuse Wallet Flutter SDK that enables you to setup a wallet & authenticate the user's provided credentials. When you send a request to the server using this method, it verifies the credentials and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) if the credentials are valid. The JWT is then used to make authenticated API requests, which allows you to access the Fuse Wallet API securely.

```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { FuseSDK } from '@fuseio/fuse-web-sdk';

const publicApiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const credentials = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string);
const fuse = await FuseSDK.init(publicApiKey, credentials);
```

### **Access the wallet**

```javascript
// Create Wallet
const smartContractAddress = fuseSDK.wallet.getSender();
console.log(`Smart contract wallet address: ${smartContractAddress}`);
```

### Sponsored Transactions

Sponsored transactions are the ability to pay for another userâ€™s transaction fees. To do this, the Fuse operator must enable the sponsored feature in his project and deposit some funds into the paymaster contract. The SDK provides a middleware to check if the project is sponsored and the amount of funds available for sponsoring.

To use this feature, you must first initialize the SDK with the `withPaymaster` parameter set to `true`.

```javascript
import { FuseSDK } from "@fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk";

const publicApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
const fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(publicApiKey, credentials, {
  withPaymaster: true,
});
```

## Send transactions

### Send single transaction<a name="callcontract"></a>

```javascript
const to = <RECEIVER_ADDRESS>;
const value = parseEther("0.001");
const data = Uint8Array.from([]);

const res = await fuseSDK.callContract(to, value, data);

console.log(`UserOpHash: ${res?.userOpHash}`);
console.log('Waiting for transaction...');
const receipt = await res?.wait();
console.log('Transaction Hash:', receipt?.transactionHash);
```

### Batch Transactions<a name="executebatch"></a>

Execute a batch of transactions atomically.

```javascript
const to = "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS";
const value = parseEther("0.001");
const data = Uint8Array.from([]);
const res = await fuseSDK.executeBatch([
  { to, value, data },
  { to, value, data },
  { to, value, data },
]);

console.log(`UserOpHash: ${res?.userOpHash}`);
console.log("Waiting for transaction...");

const receipt = await res?.wait();
console.log("Transaction Hash:", receipt?.transactionHash);
```
