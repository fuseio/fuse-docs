Install the FuseBox JS SDK:

```bash
npm install @fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk
```

Once you have installed the package, you can import it into your JS code:

```javascript
import { FuseSDK } from "@fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk";
```

### Usage

To use the FuseBox JS SDK in your project, you must create an instance of the **`FuseSDK`** class. This class is the key to interacting with the Fuse API using the SDK. Fortunately, the `FuseSDK` class provides a range of instance methods, allowing you to execute various operations with the API.

Using the SDK requires the use of the `EthersJS` library. We require the `EthersJS` library methods for creating Wallets.

```bash
npm install ethers
```

The following code initializes the Fuse SDK and creates an instance of the `FuseSDK` class. The `publicApiKey` variable should be set to your own API key.

Replace `API_KEY` with your actual API key obtained from the Fuse [Developer](https://developers.fuse.io/) Dashboard.
To enable `Paymaster`, set it as the third argument in the `init()` method. `withPaymaster: true` . It is default `false` where the argument is not provided.

```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { FuseSDK } from '@fuseio/fuse-web-sdk';

const apiKey = 'API_KEY';
const credentials = new ethers.Wallet("PRIVATE_KEY");
const fuse = await FuseSDK.init(apiKey, credentials);
```

Once you have created an instance of the `FuseSDK` class, you can use its instance methods to interact with the Fuse API. In the following section, we will cover the available methods of the SDK.
