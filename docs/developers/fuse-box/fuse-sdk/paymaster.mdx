### Sponsored Transactions

Sponsored transactions are the ability to pay for another userâ€™s transaction fees. To do this, the Fuse operator must enable the sponsored feature in his project and deposit some funds into the paymaster contract. The SDK provides a middleware to check if the project is sponsored and the amount of funds available for sponsoring.

To use this feature, you must first initialize the SDK with the _`withPaymaster`_ parameter set to true.

```javascript
import { FuseSDK } from "@fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk";

const publicApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
const fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(publicApiKey, credentials, {
  withPaymaster: true,
});
```
