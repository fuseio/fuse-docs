# Future SDKs

In addition to the current Flutter SDK, we plan to release additional SDKs for other popular languages and frameworks. These SDKs will allow developers to integrate Fuse Smart Wallets into their applications seamlessly.

Here are the upcoming SDKs and their planned release dates:

* React Native SDK (planned release: Q3 2023)
* Python SDK (planned release: Q4 2023)

We welcome feedback and suggestions from the community on what features and languages they would like to see supported by our SDKs. Please reach out to us with any feedback or suggestions.
