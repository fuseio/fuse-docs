# What is FuseBox

[FuseBox](https://github.com/fuseio/fusebox-backend) is an Open Source Wallet-As-A-Service platform based on Account Abstraction. It is ERC-4337 complaint and provides Developers the ability to use a Bundler for collacting UserOperations, and also a Paymaster to sponsor Gas payments for their users to provide a Gasless experience. FuseBox is required for building applications on the Fuse Network. It provides a set of `methods` that are available to Developers via a **REST API**, a **Flutter SDK** and a **TypeScript SDK**. Thus making is easier for Developers to interact with the Fuse Blockchain without the need to make direct RPC calls, and eliminating the need to use a node service provider.

[FuseBox Backend](https://github.com/fuseio/fusebox-backend) is developed with the NestJS framework. It relies on ERC-4337  Smart Contracts, Paymaster, Bundler, and additional API endpoints written in NodeJS.

### REST API

The Fuse API is a REST API that Developers can use to access particular features on a need basis if they prefer this method as against cloning the GitHub repository into their projects. The Smart Wallet API is powered by Account Abstraction and as a result the Smart Wallet creates Smart Contract Accounts. The API is available at the Base Endpoint: https://api.fuse.io/. The Fuse REST API is divided into:

- Smart Wallet API v2: This API enables the creation and administration of smart wallet accounts supporting the ERC-4337 standard.
- Notification API: Subscribing to the Notification API allows you to receive updates on wallet events and activities pertaining to your customers.
- Trade API: This API facilitates trading activities and provides access to trading-related data.


- **Smart Wallet API v2:** The Smart Wallet API v2 (previously referenced as Smart Wallets, now deprecated) enables Developers to Authenticate and access a `jwt` string which they can then parse to enable **sessions** for users. This enables users who Authenticate in the DApp provided by the Developer and are recognised upon sign out and sign in without the need to re-authenticate. The endpoints available are:
  - `Auth`
  - `Create Wallet`
  - `Get Wallet`
  - `Get Historical Transaction`

Below is an example using curl to create a Smart Contract Account using the endpoint

```
curl -L -X POST 'https://api.fuse.io/api/v1/smart-wallets/create' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
--data-raw '{}'
```

`Bearer` is the `jwt` **TOKEN** returned from `Auth` endpoint.

- **Notification API:** Fuse Notification API enables developers to send relevant, timely notifications on the most essential Web3 events such as External Transfers, Internal Transfers and Token Transfers. Fuse Notifications works by using webhooks, the Base url is https://api.fuse.io/api/v0/notifications/webhook. [Learn more](/docs/notification-api/notifications-api)

- **Trade API:** With the Trade API, users can buy and sell popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, stablecoins, or custom tokens dedicated to their application domain. Behind the scenes, it uses [voltage.finance](https://voltage.finance/) decentralized exchange. The endpoints available are:
  - `Price`
  - `Price Change`
  - `Stats`
  - `Swap`
  - `Tokens`

Below is an example using curl to call the `Price` endpoint for a particular token:

```
curl -L -X GET 'https://api.fuse.io/api/v0/trade/price/:tokenAddress' \
-H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Flutter SDK

The Fuse Flutter SDK is available as a Flutter [package](https://pub.dev/packages/fuse_wallet_sdk) for Mobile applications development. The Package contains all the endpoints available in the REST API.
- Create and Get Address
- Send transactions
- Approve Token Transactions
- Retry mechanism
- Send Batch Transactions

It is easy for developers to start building with the Flutter SDK. Below is an example to instantiate an app and create a Smart Contract Account:

```
import 'package:fuse_wallet_sdk/fuse_wallet_sdk.dart';
final apiKey = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY';
final privateKey = EthPrivateKey.fromHex('YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY');
final fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(apiKey, privateKey);
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### GitHub Repo

FuseBox Backend is the only Open Source project that enables developers have access to the Fuse Blockchain RPC methods without the need for a node service provider. The default open source library is free for use by developers can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/fuseio/fusebox-backend/blob/master/README.md).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### TypeScript SDK - **[COMING SOON]**

We are pleased to announce that a Typescript SDK will soon be available for our users. This SDK will be a powerful tool for developers who prefer to write code in Typescript.

The Typescript SDK will provide all the functionality of our existing API reference in an easier format for Typescript developers. It will provide a more robust set of tools for building web applications, allowing developers to build applications faster and with fewer errors.

Our team is finalizing the Typescript SDK, and we anticipate it will be released soon. Keep an eye on our website and social media channels for updates on the release date.

### Account Abstraction using FuseBox

The introduction of ERC-4337 as a standard in the Ethereum Ecosystem is a welcome development that ensures the ability to onboard the next billion users to Web3. This standard has also been extended into Fuse blockchain.

The difference is that the Fuse ecosystem provides a higher Transactions Output Per Second (TPS) and thus a faster Block Time for validating transactions. With the introduction of Account Abstraction into Fuse, DApp developers can now build without having to worry about onboarding traditional web2 users, who might have to come to use their applications and find a steep learning curve as is commonly associated with onboarding using wallets that are non-custodial and require users to recall their private keys and/or mnemonic seed phrases, given whichever scenario. So, to make it easier for developers to onboard users, Fuse has built the [Fuse Connect](fuse-connect) Wallet.
