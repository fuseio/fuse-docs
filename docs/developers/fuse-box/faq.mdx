A Fuse Smart Wallet is a non-custodial smart contract wallet that allows users to securely store, send, and receive cryptocurrency and tokens. It is built on top of the Fuse network and offers gasless transactions, making it ideal for use in dApps.

### What is the Fuse network?

The Fuse network is a decentralized platform for creating and deploying Web3 applications. It is an EVM-compatible L1 blockchain that offers fast and inexpensive transactions, making it ideal for building decentralized applications.

### What programming languages are supported by the Fuse Wallet SDK?

Currently, the Fuse Wallet SDK supports Flutter/Dart, with support for Typescript planned in the near future. We are also planning to release SDKs for React Native, Python, and Java/Kotlin.

### What is a gasless transaction?

A gasless transaction is a transaction that does not require the user to pay for gas fees. In the case of the Fuse network, gasless transactions are covered by relayers, which are incentivized to provide this service to users.

### Can I use the Fuse Wallet SDK to interact with other blockchains?

Currently, the Fuse Wallet SDK is designed to work with the Fuse network only. However, we are planning to add support for additional blockchains and networks in the future.
