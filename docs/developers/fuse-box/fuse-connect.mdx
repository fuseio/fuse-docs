There are the options to onboard users with their email address, a wallet service such as MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase. Using a Social Authentication service such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Twitch and/or Github. There is also a 3rd option for users to opt in using their Email Address.

Fuse has made this feature available in [Console](https://console.fuse.io/), a Fuse Tool for Staking and Bridging on Fuse Blockchain.

### How to use Fuse Connect

Fuse Connect will be made available to Developers as a component of the FuseBox SDK. Developers will be able to access a ready made wallet via the Flutter SDK or the API endpoints. They will not have to bother about creating a custom wallet for onboarding users. The Fuse Connect will provide an out of the Box experience where a simple method call will deploy a Smart Contract Account for a user.

The functionality can be tested for MetaMask Authentication via the Console. When you click “Connect Wallet” it will prompt the user to sign into the Console via MetaMask

It brings up the option for a user to select an EOA to connect, and once the user Connects, he can access the Fuse Network.

Fuse Connect is guaranteed to improve the performance on DApps built on Fuse by reducing the barrier to entry for developers who want to onboard users across the web2 and web3 stack. In the coming weeks developers will be able to leverage the Fuse SDK and API endpoints to build a Social Wallet experience for their users. Developers can easily integrate solutions like fiat on-ramping, authentication, and NFT minting.
