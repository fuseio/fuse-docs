### Initialization

The `init` method is a fundamental feature of the Fuse Wallet Flutter SDK that enables you to setup a wallet & authenticate the user's provided credentials. The method requires the use of a `PRIVATE_KEY` which you can get in the Fuse Developer Console [here](https://developers.fuse.io/). When you send a request to the server using this method, it verifies the credentials and if the credentials are valid, developers can use the **`getSender()`** to return an address.

```dart
//Enter your Fuse Developer API Key
final publicApiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

// Generate a random Ethereum private key
final String privateKey = await Mnemonic.generatePrivateKey();
final EthPrivateKey credentials = EthPrivateKey.fromHex(privateKey);

final fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(credentials);
```

### **Access the wallet**

```dart
// Create Wallet
final smartContractAddress = fuseSDK.wallet.getSender();
print('Smart contract wallet address: $smartContractAddress');
```
