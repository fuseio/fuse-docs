**Error - User op cannot be replaced: fee too low.**

If you're getting the `User op cannot be replaced: fee too low` error, it means that the gas price you set is too low. You can increase the gas price by setting the `TxOptions` parameter when sending a transaction. To replace an user operation, a new user operation must have at least 10% higher `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and 10% higher `maxPriorityFeePerGas` than the one in the user operation mempool.

To replace the user operation, the new gas price must be at least 10% higher.

```dart
final res = await fuseSDK.transferToken(
    EthereumAddress.fromHex('TOKEN_ADDRESS'),
    EthereumAddress.fromHex('RECIPIENT_ADDRESS'),
    BigInt.parse('AMOUNT_IN_WEI'),
    FuseSDK.defaultTxOptions.copyWith(
      feePerGas: '11000000000',
      withRetry: true,
      feeIncrementPercentage: 11,
    ),
);
print('UserOpHash: ${res.userOpHash}');
print('Waiting for transaction...');
final ev = await res.wait();
```
