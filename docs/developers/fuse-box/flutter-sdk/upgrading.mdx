## Upgrading from lower versions to v0.2

#### Introduction

Welcome to the updated version of the `fuse_wallet_sdk`. Our primary objective for this migration is to seamlessly align our services with the evolving landscape of EVM-based chains. We are thrilled to introduce the incorporation of the new standard, EIP 4337, commonly known as "Account Abstraction". This latest protocol promises to enhance security, provide more consistent developer experiences, and offer improved user interactions in Ethereum-based environments.

**Major Changes at a Glance**:

- **Seamless Smart Wallet Creation**: Gone are the days where we required an API request to the Fuse APIs to craft a smart wallet. With the renewed `fuse_wallet_sdk`, initiation not only sets the SDK in motion but also seamlessly creates a smart wallet for the given owner. This elevates user experience, reduces developer friction, and augments transactional efficiency.

As we navigate through the details of this migration, we hope to provide you with a clear roadmap, making the transition as straightforward as possible. Embracing the future of Ethereum-based chains has never been this effortless.

#### Prerequisites

Before embarking on this migration journey with the new `fuse_wallet_sdk`, the process is made delightfully simple for our users. However, there's a minimal requirement you should be aware of:

- **API Key**: The only prerequisite to utilize the updated SDK is to have a valid API key. If you haven't create one yet or need a new one, don't fret! Simply head over to our Developer's Console at https://developers.fuse.io/ and follow the straightforward steps to obtain your key.

With your API key in hand, you're all set to integrate and experience the enhanced capabilities of the `fuse_wallet_sdk`.

#### Detailed Migration Steps

**Initialization and Smart Wallet Creation**

1.  **Locate the Old Initialization**:
    Start by finding your old SDK initialization in your code. This is typically where you have the `FuseWalletSDK` instantiation.
2.  **Remove Wallet Creation Steps**:
    In the old SDK, there were multiple steps involved in creating a smart wallet, including authenticating the credentials, creating a wallet, and handling the creation events. These steps are now greatly simplified in the new SDK.
    Identify and remove the following sections from your old SDK code:

    - The authentication step: `await fuseWalletSDK.authenticate(credentials);`
    - The wallet creation step: `await fuseWalletSDK.createWallet();`
    - The entire `onSmartWalletEvent` function and its associated event listening code.

3.  **Update SDK Initialization**:
    Replace the old initialization:

```dart
final FuseWalletSDK fuseWalletSDK = FuseWalletSDK(publicApiKey);
```

with the new one:

```dart
final fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(publicApiKey, credentials);
```

4.  **Access the Smart Contract Wallet Address**:
    In the new SDK, you can obtain the smart contract wallet address directly after initialization. Replace the older method:

```dart
print('Smart contract wallet address: ${fuseWalletSDK.smartWallet.smartWalletAddress}');
```

with the simplified new version:

```dart
print('Smart contract wallet address: ${fuseSDK.wallet.getSender()}');

```

By following the steps above, developers can smoothly transition to the new SDK and take advantage of the more streamlined and simplified process provided by the update. Itâ€™s worth noting that the migration not only reduces the lines of code but also enhances clarity and reduces complexity, resulting in a more efficient and cleaner integration process.

In summary, the new SDK code provides a more structured, modular, and extensive set of functions to interact with FuseBox. It allows for a broader range of operations, from basic token transfers to more complex operations like staking and swapping tokens. The design considerations (like separating modules) make the SDK more maintainable and scalable.
