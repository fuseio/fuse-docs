The [Fuse Wallet SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/fuse_wallet_sdk) is a set of tools for creating, managing, and engaging with Fuse Wallet SDK in client applications. Fuse Wallet SDK lets users create smart contract wallets([Based on ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337)) associated with each user's Externally Owned Account (EOA) that provide added security compared to traditional EOAs with a single private key. With Fuse Wallet SDK, users can deposit funds that no one else can control and withdraw at any time.
