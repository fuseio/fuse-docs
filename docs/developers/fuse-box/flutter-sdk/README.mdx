The [Fuse Wallet SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/fuse_wallet_sdk) is a set of tools for building on Fuse Blockchain in client applications. Fuse Wallet SDK enables developers create Smart Contract Wallets ([Based on ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) Standard) associated with each user's Externally Owned Account (EOA), and that provides added security compared to traditional EOAs with a single private key. With Fuse Wallet SDK, users can deposit funds that no one else can control and withdraw at any time.
