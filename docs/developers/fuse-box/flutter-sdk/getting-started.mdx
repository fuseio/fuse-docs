# Getting Started

Before you start using the Fuse Wallet Flutter SDK, you must complete a few prerequisites. Once you have completed these prerequisites, you must install and configure the Fuse Wallet SDK in your application.

* Flutter: version 2.0 or higher
* Dart: version 2.19 or higher
* A Fuse developers account and an associated API key

Installing Flutter and Dart is a straightforward process; you can find detailed instructions on the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) website. Once you have installed Flutter and Dart, you must create a Fuse developers account if you don't already have one.
