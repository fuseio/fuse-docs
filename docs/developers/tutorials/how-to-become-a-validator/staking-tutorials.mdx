**How to Unstake FUSE:**

Click on the Validator name and you should see the validator name with address on the right-hand side. Click on “**Unstake**” and enter the amount you want to unstake and click on “**Unstake**”. Confirm the transaction on Metamask and wait for the on-chain confirmation. Once the transaction is confirmed the unstaked amount is transferred back to your address.
