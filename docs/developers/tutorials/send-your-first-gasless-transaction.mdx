## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating a user operation, obtaining sponsorship from FuseBox's verifying paymaster, and submitting this sponsored user operation on-chain using the bundler. By leveraging FuseBox's capabilities, you can execute on-chain transactions efficiently and without the need for gas.

### Obtain an API Key

Start by visiting our [Operator Dashboard](https://console.fuse.io/build) to generate an API key, a crucial step for accessing our services.

### Clone the FuseBox Tutorial Template Repository

We've prepared a [FuseBox tutorial template repository](https://github.com/fuseio/tutorial-template) with Typescript, viem, and @fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk to help you get started. Clone the repository and prepare your development environment by executing the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fuseio/tutorial-template.git fusebox-tutorial
cd fusebox-tutorial
npm install
```

The primary file you'll be working with is `index.ts`. Verify your setup by running `npm start`; you should see `Hello world!` in the console.

### Generate a Private Key

Securely generate and store a private key using the code snippet below in `index.ts`:

```typescript
const privateKey =
  process.env.PRIVATE_KEY ??
  (() => {
    const pk = generatePrivateKey();
    writeFileSync(".env", `PRIVATE_KEY=${pk}`);
    return pk;
  })();
```

### Initialize the SDK

With FuseSDK, you can create User Operations for ERC-4337 Etherspot Smart Accounts, Bundler services, or Paymasters. It is open source and MIT licensed for maximum flexibility. Ensure you replace `YOUR_FUSEBOX_API_KEY` with your actual API key:

```typescript
const apiKey = "YOUR_FUSEBOX_API_KEY";
const credentials = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey);
const fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(apiKey, credentials, {
  withPaymaster: true,
});
```

### Create a Smart Contract Wallet

Use the SDK and your private key to initialize the Etherspot Smart Account. Display the smart account address by running:

```typescript
console.log(
  `Smart account address: https://explorer.fuse.io/address/${fuseSDK.wallet.getSender()}`
);
```

This smart account is counterfactual, meaning it will be deployed on-chain with your first transaction.

### Submit a Transaction

Submit a transaction from the smart account to `0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045` (`vitalik.eth`) using `0x1234` as the call data. The FuseSDK will facilitate this operation, including obtaining sponsorship and submission:

```typescript
const to = "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"; // for vitalik.eth
const value = ethers.utils.parseEther("0");
const data = new TextEncoder().encode("0x1234");
const res = await fuseSDK.callContract(to, value, data);

console.log(`UserOpHash: ${res?.userOpHash}`);
console.log("Waiting for transaction...");

const receipt = await res?.wait();

console.log(
  `User operation included: https://explorer.fuse.io/tx/${receipt?.transactionHash}`
);
```

Running this will display the transaction hash and confirm your operation is on-chain.

Congratulations! You've executed a gasless transaction, deployed a smart account, verified its signature, had the operation sponsored, and performed a transaction to `vitalik.eth` - all seamlessly with a few lines of code.
