### Get Started with Fuse

This guide will provide you with an overview of the Fuse ecosystem. It will also include links to helpful resources and websites that will help you learn more about building blockchain applications, not only on Fuse but also on other platforms.

### Building on Fuse

If you are an Ethereum developer, you are already a Fuse developer. Simply switch to the [Fuse RPC](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/basics/getting-started-with-fuse/network-details) and get started. All the tools you are familiar with on the Ethereum blockchain are supported on Fuse by default, such as Truffle, Remix, and Web3js.

You can deploy decentralized applications to either Fuse Spark Testnet or the Mainnet.

### Publicly available Fuse RPC endpoints

Check out a [list of public endpoints](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/basics/getting-started-with-fuse/rpc#fuse-labs) for the Fuse Network.

### Subgaphs

You can easily get the indexed data from the blockchain through the different [subgraphs solutions](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/developers/subgraphs/) available on Fuse Network.

### Oracles

Fuse integrated with industry-leader [oracle providers](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/developers/oracles) Dia and Supra for maximum flexibility to access price feeds.

### Wallets

To interact with the Fuse Network, you need to have an Ethereum-based wallet because Fuse runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). You can add Fuse to [MetaMask](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/basics/getting-started-with-fuse/wallets/add-fuse-to-metamask-and-other-wallets), which allows you to connect to Fuse using [RPC](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/basics/getting-started-with-fuse/wallets/add-fuse-to-metamask-and-other-wallets).

You can find the wallets currently supporting the Fuse Network blockchain [here](https://fuse.io/ecosystem) (filter using the tag "Wallet").

### Smart Contracts

Fuse supports many services you can use to test, compile, debug, and deploy decentralized applications onto the Fuse Network. These include deployment using [Hardhat](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/developers/deploying-smart-contracts/using-hardhat), [Thirdweb](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/developers/deploying-smart-contracts/using-thirdweb) and [Remix](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/developers/deploying-smart-contracts/using-remix-and-metamask).

Fuse Token (FUSE) is the native token on the Fuse Network. Its official versions exist on the Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and Arbitrum networks. [Here](https://docs.fuse.io/docs/developers/important-smart-contracts/fuse-token-on-other-chains) you can find relevant smart contracts.

### Building a new dApp on Fuse?

Decentralized applications (dApps) serve as the link between users and data privacy on the blockchain. The growing prevalence of dApps underscores their value in the blockchain environment, addressing issues such as facilitating transactions between two parties without a central authority through smart contracts.

If you're new to creating decentralized applications (dApps), the resources mentioned below will provide you with a jumpstart on the necessary tools to construct, troubleshoot, and launch dApps on the Fuse Network.

### Note

If you find all of this overwhelming, don't worry! You can jump right in and start experimenting. However, here are a few things to keep in mind before you dive into the available resources, repositories, and documentation:

1. Be aware of the challenges of being on the cutting edge: Like any specialized field of programming, dApps and blockchain development evolve rapidly. During your research, you may come across complex code repositories, documentation sites with broken links, or even a lack of documentation altogether. Take this as an opportunity to reach out to us through any social media channel for assistance.
2. The learning curve may seem intimidating, but the entry barrier is low: The community is incredibly open and welcoming! Projects actively encourage contributions from external developers and are committed to resolving any obstacles you may encounter. We are all working towards creating a better world, and any form of contribution is highly appreciated. We would be thrilled to have you join this incredible Web3 ecosystem.
