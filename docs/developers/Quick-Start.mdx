## Building on Fuse

### Creating a Fuse Wallet

To interact with the Fuse Blockchain, you'll need a wallet. Follow the [Fuse Metamask guide](../basics/guides/tutorialsOverview) to set up your wallet.


### Choosing a Development Option

Fuse is EVM compatible and uses Solidity programming languages for smart contract development.

Fuse provides a set of APIs for building on the Fuse blockchain, and also a Web SDK and Flutter SDK for building Mobile Apps.

### Writing and Deploying Smart Contracts

You can use [Remix IDE](../developers/deploying-smart-contracts/using-remix-and-metamask), [Hardhat](../developers/deploying-smart-contracts/using-hardhat), and/or [ThirdWeb](../developers/deploying-smart-contracts/using-thirdweb) to deploy and test your smart contracts.

Learn how to interact with smart contracts using web3 libraries. Fuse supports Ethereum-compatible libraries like Web3.js and ethers.js.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Fuse Developer Tools

### FuseBox

[Create your project](https://console.fuse.io/build) to access FuseBox APIs.

### SDK (Both TS & Dart)

Fuse provides a variety of tools and SDKs to enhance your development experience.

[Fuse API documentation](../api-introduction) for comprehensive information on FuseBox APIs, endpoints, and tutorials.
