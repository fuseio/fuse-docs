The SDKs for both [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/fuse_wallet_sdk) and [JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk) offer a comprehensive toolkit for developing client applications on the Fuse Blockchain. The FuseBox SDK empowers developers to create Smart Contract Wallets ([based on the ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) standard) linked to each user's Externally Owned Account (EOA), enhancing security beyond the conventional EOA's reliance on a single private key. This SDK facilitates exclusive control over funds by users, allowing deposits that remain inaccessible to others and withdrawals that can be executed at any time.
