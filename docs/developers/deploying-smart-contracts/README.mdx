# Build on Fuse

Getting your dApp live on Fuse is simple:

- Replace the generic RPC address with a Fuse-specific one for targeted deployment.

[Please see the RPC page for more details.](../../basics/getting-started-with-fuse/network-details.mdx)

- The network id must be updated.
- Switch the Default Network to Fuse
