### AA on Fuse

The introduction of Account Abstraction as a standard in the Ethereum Ecosystem is a welcome development that ensures the ability to onboard the next billion users to Web3. This standard has also been extended into Fuse blockchain. Fuse is EVM compatible and this typically means that features available on Ethereum are available on the Fuse blockchain.

The difference is that the Fuse ecosystem provides a higher Transactions Output Per Second (TPS) and thus a faster Block Time for validating transactions. With the introduction of Account Abstraction into Fuse, DApp developers can now build without having to worry about onboarding traditional web2 users, who might have to come to use their applications and find a steep learning curve as is commonly associated with onboarding using wallets that are non-custodial and require users to recall their private keys and/or mnemonic seed phrases, given whichever scenario. So, to make it easier for developers to onboard users, Fuse has built the FuseConnects Wallet.

### FuseConnect

The FuseConnect Wallet is powered by Web3Auth, and enables developers to build a simple onboarding experience for their users with extra functionalities of integrating Social Authentication and by default Social Recovery. By clicking one button. Users can create Smart Contract Accounts deployed on Fuse Network powered by Account Abstraction.

There are the options to onboard users with their email address, a wallet service such as MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase. Using a Social Authentication service such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Twitch and/or Github. There is also a 3rd option for users to opt in using their Email Address.

Fuse has made this feature available in [Console](https://console.fuse.io/), a Fuse Tool for Staking and Bridging on Fuse Blockchain.

### How to use FuseConnect

FuseConnect will be made available to Developers as a component of the FuseBox SDK. Developers will be able to access a ready made wallet via the Flutter SDK or the API endpoints. They will not have to bother about creating a custom wallet for onboarding users. The FuseConnect will provide an out of the Box experience where a simple method call will deploy a Smart Contract Account for a user.

The functionality can be tested for MetaMask Authentication via the Console. When you click “Connect Wallet” it will prompt the user to sign into the Console via MetaMask

It brings up the option for a user to select an EOA to connect, and once the user Connects, he can access the Fuse Network.

FuseConnect is guaranteed to improve the performance on DApps built on Fuse by reducing the barrier to entry for developers who want to onboard users across the web2 and web3 stack. In the coming weeks developers will be able to leverage the Fuse SDK and API endpoints to build a Social Wallet experience for their users. Developers can easily integrate solutions like fiat on-ramping, authentication, and NFT minting.
