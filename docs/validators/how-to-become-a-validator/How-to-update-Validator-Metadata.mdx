# How to update Validator Metadata

Successfully running a node? Follow these steps to update your metadata to be displayed on [Staking App](https://staking.fuse.io/ "Staking App"):

### Step 1: Fork the Repository:

Start by forking the [repository](https://github.com/fuseio/fuse-staking-v2) to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your account that you can work with.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository:

Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local machine using a Git client. This will create a local copy of the repository that you can modify.

To clone the repository run this command in your terminal:

`git clone <url of forked repository>`

### Step 3: Create a New Branch:

Create a new branch in your local repository to work on the changes. It's recommended to create a branch specifically for this update, such as "update-\<validator>-data(image/website/description/name)".

To create a new branch, navigate to the cloned repository and run

`git checkout -b <branch name>`

### Step 4: Make the Necessary Changes:

Navigate to `src/validators/validators.json`

* If you want to update your metadata, search for your node address, and make changes to the attribute next to it, currently 4 attributes are supported:
  1. name:- Name of your validating node
  2. image:- Location of your node's image, all images are located in `src/assets/logos` you are required to update/add the logo in the same directory, and your image attribute should look like "logos/\<image name>"
  3. website:- the website for your validating node
  4. description:- description to be displayed for your node
* If you are adding a new node, add an entry at the **end** of the JSON object with your node's address as the key and follow the above instruction.

Please note that all the attributes are **optional**, but we encourage you to provide all the details as this increases trust among users.

### Step 5: Commit and Push the changes:

Once you have made the necessary changes, commit them to your local branch. First, add all the files that you have changed and then provide a meaningful commit message that describes the purpose of the changes. for eg

```shell
git add <file names>
git commit -m "[VALIDATOR] Update Voltage Image"
```

Push the changes from your local branch to the corresponding branch in your forked repository on GitHub.

```shell
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### Step 6: Open a Pull Request:

On the user's original repository page, you should see an option to compare and open a new pull request. Click on it, and select your branch as the source branch and the target branch as `master` where we want it merged, provide a short description, and ask for a review. If the review is a success, your PR will be merged and changes will be live within a few minutes of merging.
