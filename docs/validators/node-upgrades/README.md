# Node Upgrades

Significant updates on the network level are introduced via forks.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Forks are used to introduce new functionality or fix security-related issues. Node runners will receive instructions on how and when to update their nodes in the event of a fork.
{% endhint %}

Information related to forks and upgrade information will be posted here. Feel free to reach out or ask questions through the forum or other channels if any assistance is needed.
