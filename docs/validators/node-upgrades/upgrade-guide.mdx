This guide assumes that you have created your node via our [quickstart script](https://github.com/fuseio/fuse-network/blob/master/scripts/quickstart.sh). If you have built your own client using our spec, ensure that your client matches the officially supported client and use the most up-to-date [chain spec](https://github.com/fuseio/fuse-network/blob/master/config/spec.json).
