# Treasury

As of November 2024, Fuse Network’s Treasury holds approximately 137,000,000 $FUSE.

We have adopted this multi-pool approach for diversification to achieve an optimal balance between immediate operational needs, investment in future growth, and strategic incentives. This approach minimizes risk, provides liquidity for ongoing development, and safeguards the network against potential market volatility during a bear cycle. From the beginning, we have aligned our diversification strategies with best practices in treasury management to emphasize resilience and sustainability.
