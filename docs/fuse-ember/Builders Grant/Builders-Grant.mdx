# How To Participate In The Fuse Ember Grant Program

The Fuse Ember Grant Program will disburse up to 20 million FUSE tokens to projects seeking  to bootstrap their applications on a new network and build a new community and user base.

Qualifying projects will receive **up to $15,000 in FUSE**, plus a potential **bonus of up to $5,000** if certain conditions are met. They will also receive back up to **90% of network fees** their project generates, providing a long-term and sustainable source of revenues.

Grants are intended to be used as incentives to attract end users, not as core project funds. Below, you’ll find more information about the terms of the grant program, and which projects can expect to qualify.

## 1. For Established Projects And MVPs

In order to qualify for a Fuse Ember grant, your project should either be:

* **Active on an existing network**. You will use the grant to expand your user base, grow your on-chain activity, and generate sustainable revenues.
* **In beta or at MVP stage, with a working product**. You will be seeking your first users, aiming to establish a foothold in the Web3 space on Fuse Ember.

The grants program is **not designed for early-stage projects** seeking seed investment. Grant payments are not intended to be used for core funding, but as incentives for users to reward them for interacting with your app.

For this reason, funds will only be disbursed to projects after they have deployed on Fuse Ember mainnet, once the blockchain has gone live.

## Ongoing Revenues

While grant funds are not intended to act as core funding, we do want to help projects create long-term revenue streams and position them for success. Successful grant applicants will receive back up to 90% of the network fees (gas) that their apps generate.

# 2. Positioned For Growth

Aside from being established on an existing network or ready to deploy on Fuse, qualifying projects should have a **strong business model and plan for growth**. Projects will be assessed on multiple criteria, including:

* Does the platform offer real value to users? Is it an innovative use of blockchain technology?
* Have the founders formulated realistic projections for future growth and earnings, based on reasonable assumptions and data?
* Has the platform been designed and built with a high level of competence? Does it offer the functionality needed to attract users at scale?
* Does the project have the potential to positively impact the wider Fuse Ember network ecosystem? Are there opportunities for partnerships and synergies with other projects?

# 3. Qualifying Categories

While we welcome applications from across the spectrum of Web3 use cases, projects will typically fall into one of the following overall categories:

1. **Payments**. This might include merchant tools and debit cards that support FUSE and USDC payments.
2. **Stablecoins**. These can include collateralized decentralized stablecoins, yield-bearing stablecoins, tokens backed by real-world assets, and other implementations.
3. **Yield**. For example, fixed yield products, yield aggregators, and cross-chain yield tokenization.
4. **Web3 Gaming**. Play-to-earn titles, single-click “mining” games, prediction markets, and other gamified applications.
5. **Tooling**. This might include liquid staking and liquid locker protocols, and voting incentive markets.
6. **Lending**, such as simple lending markets or isolated lending markets.
7. **Community-based Movements**: Brand ambassador campaigns, user-engagement campaigns, and other engagement mechanisms.
8. **Exchanges**. Perpetual markets, options markets, AMMs, and conventional CEX (CLOB) exchanges.
9. **DePIN and AI**. This includes wireless networks, energy grids, decentralized computation and storage, and AI-integrated applications.

If your project falls outside of these broad categories, please contact the Fuse Labs team for more information.

# 4. Award Amounts And Conditions

Grants will be disbursed in tranches, with the first tranche only paid out after the project has been deployed on the Fuse Ember mainnet.

Subsequent tranches will be disbursed at periodic intervals (to be agreed in advance), following proof that previous funds have been spent for the intended purpose – i.e. rewards for end users.

Grants applications will be shortlisted by a panel from the Fuse Labs team, and a community vote will then be held to decide which projects receive funding. 

The final amount of each grant will be determined by the panel, and will **not exceed $15,000** in FUSE tokens. Additional rewards **up to $5,000** in FUSE are available for builders who incorporate the following into their projects:

1. FuseBox SDK or APIs.
2. Safe's tools, such as multi-signature security, backup and recovery protocols, and other features.

The grants program will continue to run until the entire budget of 20 million FUSE has been distributed.
