Ethereum-compatible blockchains use two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Smart Contract accounts (or Smart Accounts).

### Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)

* Controlled by private keys: These accounts are controlled by an individual or entity with access to a private key, which enables them to authorize transactions.
* No associated code: EOAs do not have code or smart contract logic attached to them. They are simply used to send and receive transactions and hold Ether or other tokens.
* Transaction fees: Whenever an EOA initiates a transaction (e.g., sending Ether, interacting with a smart contract), it must pay a transaction fee (also known as gas) using Ether.

### Smart Contract Accounts

Smart Contract accounts are controlled by smart contract code. Because they are programmable, they offer a high degree of flexibility. Smart Accounts are very flexible, and can provide advanced features such as recovery, custom permissions, and gasless transactions (or paying with tokens). However, they cannot issue the transactions themselves. Currently, the network deals with this by leveraging the ERC4337 standard.Â 

### Account Abstraction

Account abstraction (AA) is a feature that provides a high degree of flexibility for Fuse transactions and users by integrating smart contract functionality into regular end-user accounts. AA can be used to decrease common barriers to adoption by reducing the burdens on users. For example, it can be used to pay network fees in specific tokens, avoiding the need for users to keep topping up their wallets with FUSE for gas. It can also be used to customize security options and improve overall user experience.
