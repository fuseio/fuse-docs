With Native Account Abstraction, every account supports AA by default.

The team is currently studying a few implementations of how to bring native AA to Fuse Ember. This would enable the introduction of features like multi-signature security, gasless transactions, smart contract wallets, and more complex account logic without relying on external contract deployment, keeping a robust, secured, MEV-free solution without the disadvantages of ERC-4337.

## Why Native (vs 4337)?

* Native AA is implemented in the protocol. ERC-4337 provides easy integration with Ethereum, but having this as a second level-implementation brings restrictions and security risks, including more opportunities for MEV. A native implementation solves these issues.
* First class citizen: smart accounts are first class citizens, and are easy to use and leverage.
* Gas stipends for everyone. All accounts can enjoy gas abstraction and pay gas fees with ERC20 tokens.

# Native AA on Ember

With Fuse Ember’s Native AA, every account now is a a smart contract account and all transactions go through the native transaction cycle, together with EOA transactions. 

Native account abstraction means:

* All accounts implement an IAccount standard interface that defines the methods that each smart contract account must implement.
* Native AA supports the accounts JSON RPC module, meaning all EOA wallets (like MetaMask) are supported by default.
* By default, all contracts go through the DefaultAccount, which mimics EOA behavior. 
* All accounts have native support for a paymaster, meaning any account can sponsor the gas fees for another account’s transactions, or pay gas fees in another ERC20 token.

With Native Account Abstraction, smart wallets and paymasters are first class primitives that are natively supported by the network. This uses EOA with Native AA as a default smart contract that can be extended with additional features. All accounts follow the same standard interface and go through the same transaction cycle.
