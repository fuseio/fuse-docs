Unlike the old L1 Fuse Network, staking on the new L2 Fuse Ember network will have a fundamentally different profitability mechanism.

The Fuse team propose the creation of a native revenue share token on the Fuse Ember network, called stFUSE, which will distribute revenue from various activities across the network. This token will also enable liquid staking, allowing rewards to auto-compound, be (re)staked, and remain compatible with DeFi. In doing so, stFUSE introduces both a new governance model and a new revenue model to the Fuse ecosystem.

Moving away from the legacy inflationary model, this proposal suggests a sustainable and secure approach, where rewards are tied to real network activity.
