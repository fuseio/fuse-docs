#### Discount

When paying for a license with FUSE tokens, the buyer receives a 10% discount both during the pre-sale and public sale. 

### After mainnet launch

#### Node operators incentives

The uninterrupted operation of the network is guaranteed by the Data Availability Committee, which consists of Data Availability Nodes. Each node license owner can launch a DA node.

* Fuse Foundation incentive. Fuse Foundation allocates 10,000,000 FUSE to rewards for node operators\*, which will be distributed monthly over 3 years.
* External incentive. Share of Fuse Foundation revenues from sequencer fees, new staking dApp, etc, will be distributed across active node operators.
* Delegation fees from node delegators. The node operator receives 10% of the total earnings of the license delegator.

*\* If a license is not used to maintain an active node and is not delegated to an active node, then the license owner is not entitled to any reward.*

#### Node delegators incentives

If the license owner doesn't want to run a node, they may delegate the license to any active node operator. In this case, the license delegator will be entitled to all the same rewards as node operators, but the operator will charge 10% delegation fees of the earnings.

#### License voting power

Each license has voting power. By delegating it, the owner transfers voting power to the node operator.
