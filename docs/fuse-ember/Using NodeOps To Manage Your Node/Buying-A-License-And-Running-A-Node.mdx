Setting up your Ember node with NodeOps is fast and straightforward.

You will need an EVM-compatible wallet like MetaMask, some $FUSE to pay the transaction fee on the Fuse network, and sufficient funds or credits for your Node subscription.

1. Use the NodeOps [Console](https://console.nodeops.network/) to sign up or log in using the Log In button at the bottom left of the Console. Sign in with your EVM wallet. (This is recommended, but you can choose to sign in with email or Google and connect a wallet later.) Click Connect, and confirm the connection with your wallet.
2. Ensure your wallet is connected, then click Deploy Node (left-hand side of the menu) and select Fuse Network.
3. Select the correct node tier, the number of nodes you want to purchase, and the subscription period, then click Pay. You can pay with $FUSE or other supported cryptocurrencies using your Web3 wallet, or with credit card via NodeOps' payment partner, Copperx.
4. Following payment confirmation, you will be you will be redirected to [NodeFolio](https://console.nodeops.network/dashboard). After a couple of minutes, the Deployment status should change from Pending to Running. The logs will automatically display validation information.
5. You can delegate your node using the Click To Delegate button (see more in the following page).
