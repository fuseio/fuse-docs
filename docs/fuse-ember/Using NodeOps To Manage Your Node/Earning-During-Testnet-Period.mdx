title: Earning During Testnet Period

While Fuse Ember is at the testnet stage, node operators and delegators will receive **points** that will be converted into $FUSE tokens after mainnet launches.

Nodes must **actively participate** in the network in order to earn points, and for any delegators to earn. It is therefore worth monitoring nodes for activity and uptime to ensure points are not lost.

**1,000 points per license** will be awarded **daily at 10:00 UTC +3**, for every license that is either used to maintain an active node, or delegated to an active node operator.

Node operators can use the NodeOps interface to **set fees**, specifying what percentage of the delegator's earnings they will receive as a commission. This fee (if it has been set) will automatically be deducted from the delegator's daily points and added to the node operator's balance. If a fee has not been specified, then both node operator and delegator receive the same, 1,000 points per license.

Please note that points will **only be converted to $FUSE tokens after the launch of the Ember mainnet**.
