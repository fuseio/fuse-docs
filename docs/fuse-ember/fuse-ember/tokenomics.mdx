In early 2025, Fuse will launch a new network called Fuse Ember. Fuse Ember is designed to reshape business payments and drive decentralized finance to new heights by leveraging advanced zkEVM technology, bringing unparalleled scalability, speed, and privacy. This major upgrade will roll out in stages, with a series of posts detailing each phase and new functionality.

Fuse Ember will operate alongside the current network, gradually migrating existing FUSE tokens to ensure a seamless transition. With zero inflation and a fixed supply of 420 million stFUSE tokens, Fuse Ember sets the foundation for a sustainable, deflationary ecosystem.

## Key Advantages of the Fuse Ember Migration

The migration to the Fuse Ember network introduces several advantages that enhance the overall ecosystem:

- **Enhanced Network Security:** The stFUSE token strengthens the network’s resilience by enabling liquid staking, allowing users to auto-compound rewards. By staking and delegating voting power to Data Availability (DA) node operators, participants actively contribute to Fuse Ember’s security.
- **Sustainable Economic Model:** Moving away from inflationary frameworks, Fuse Ember’s fixed supply and deflationary model tie rewards directly to network activity, supporting long-term stability without diluting token value.
- **Revenue Sharing for stFUSE Holders:** stFUSE holders share in revenue generated from node sales and sequencer fees, creating a sustainable and ongoing reward model as the network grows.
- **Frictionless DeFi and Staking Integration:** stFUSE enables seamless access to DeFi and staking activities without the need for complex bridges, reducing barriers for users and developers alike.
- **Community-Driven Governance:** With stFUSE, holders can lock tokens and participate in governance, influencing decisions that shape Fuse Network’s future by selecting DA node operators and driving community-led policies.

#### Final details will be shared soon and voted on by the community.
