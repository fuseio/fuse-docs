### Public Saleâ€‹

- A total of 50,000 node licenses are available for purchase at various tiers, allowing buyers to enter at multiple levels. As the tiers progress, prices will adjust, so early participation offers prime entry into the Fuse ecosystem.
- Public Sale Discount: When paying for a license with FUSE tokens, the buyer receives a 15% discount both during the pre-sale and public sale.

### Ongoing node sale

- Once the mainnet launches and the active bootstrapping phase of the Fuse Ember network has completed, node sales will continue until all 50,000 licenses have been sold.

### Testnet incentive

- The new Flash testnet will be launched before the pre-sale, which will allow the first buyers of a license to immediately launch a Data Availability Node on the testnet and start receiving Node incentives every month. The total amount of Node incentives is 15,000,000 FUSE which will be distributed monthly over 3 years.
- Delegators on Flash testnet will also be eligible for Node incentive.

## After Mainnet Launchâ€‹

### Post-Mainnet Launch Incentivesâ€‹

- Node Operators: Secure the network as part of the Data Availability Committee and earn rewards through monthly distributions from a pool of 10 million FUSE tokens over three years. Additional incentives include a share of sequencer fees, revenue from a new staking dApp, and delegation fees.
- Node Delegators: License holders who do not wish to operate a node can delegate their license to active operators, earning rewards while the operator retains 10% of the earnings as a fee.
- Voting Power: Each license provides voting power, which can be transferred to the chosen node operator during delegation.

## Opportunityâ€‹

Validator Nodes on the Fuse Ember network are integral for maintaining decentralization and processing transactions. By participating in the network, node operators can earn rewards through a portion of the 15% allocated token supply and transaction fees. The Node Sale Event aims to empower the community by offering a path to participate in the network's governance and transaction validationâ€‹.

Node NFT holders gain access to multiple benefits, including:

- Staking rewards through transaction fees and a share of 15% of the FUSE token supply.
- Governance rights, allowing participants to vote on protocol upgrades and ecosystem development.
- Access to early features and airdrops within the ecosystem.
- Priority in future token sales and strategic partner collaborationsâ€‹

  The Node Sale strategy includes offering both whole and fractionalized node licenses to ensure broad accessibility and geographical distribution, fostering a robust and diverse validator communityâ€‹.

  If the license owner doesn't want to run a node, they may delegate the license to any active node operator. In this case, the license delegator will be entitled to all the same rewards as node operators, but the operator will charge 10% delegation fees of the earnings.

  Delegators on Flash testnet will also be eligible for Node incentive.

\* If a license is not used to maintain an active node and is not delegated to an active node, then the license owner is not entitled to any reward.
