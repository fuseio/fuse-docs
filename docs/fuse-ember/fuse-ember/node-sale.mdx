# Fuse Ember Node Sale

The Fuse Ember Node Sale went live on **February 11, 2025**.

In preparation for the launch of the zkEVM-powered Fuse Ember L2 in Q2 2025, we are offering up to **[12,000 exclusive node licenses](https://console.nodeops.xyz/bootstrap-event/fuse)** to the Fuse community. Nodes will secure the network, processing up to 9,000 transactions per second, while earning a share of ecosystem fees and early adopter incentives.

As a node operator, you'll also play a key role in governance, helping to determine the future of blockchain-powered business payments. This is a chance to own a stake in a growing ecosystem built for real-world adoption. Once these 12,000 licenses are gone, no further nodes will be sold, making this a unique opportunity for the Fuse community and other investors to become a pivotal part of Fuse's zkEVM-powered ecosystem.

**Key features of the Fuse Ember network include:**

* Global payments with effortless integration.
* High throughput (9,000 tps) and low fees of $0.0001/tx
* AI agents for businesses
* ZK payments for mainstream usage
* Vertically-integrated open source stack
* Full mobile compatibility
* Recurring payments
