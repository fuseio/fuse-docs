### Fuse Ember Node Sale: Empowering the Next-Gen zkEVM Network

The Fuse Ember launch is set to drive innovation and growth for our business payments infrastructure, with an upcoming node sale. This is a unique opportunity for the Fuse community and other investors to become a pivotal part of Fuse's zkEVM-powered ecosystem.

### Key Goals

- **Bootstrapping Network Migration:** Power the next stage of Fuse's evolution, from liquidity to governance
- **Attract New Node Operators:** Join a growing community of committed node owners
- **Strategic Fundraising:** Supporting partnerships, protocol integrations, and token listings

### Before Mainnet Launch

#### Pre-Sale

- Early participants can acquire node licenses in a closed pre-sale, prioritizing existing validators and investors.

#### Whitelist Access

- A whitelist opens with the pre-sale, granting exclusive access to additional tiers available in the public sale.

#### Public Sale

- A total of 50,000 node licenses are available for purchase at various tiers, allowing buyers to enter at multiple levels. As the tiers progress, prices will adjust, so early participation offers prime entry into the Fuse ecosystem.

### After Mainnet Launch

#### Post-Mainnet Launch Incentives

- **Node Operators:** Secure the network as part of the Data Availability Committee and earn rewards through monthly distributions from a pool of 10 million FUSE tokens over three years. Additional incentives include a share of sequencer fees, revenue from a new staking dApp, and delegation fees.
- **Node Delegators:** License holders who do not wish to operate a node can delegate their license to active operators, earning rewards while the operator retains 10% of the earnings as a fee.
- **Voting Power:** Each license provides voting power, which can be transferred to the chosen node operator during delegation.

### Opportunity

**Validator Nodes** on the Fuse Ember network are integral for maintaining decentralization and processing transactions. By participating in the network, node operators can earn rewards through a portion of the 15% allocated token supply and transaction fees. The Node Sale Event aims to empower the community by offering a path to participate in the network's governance and transaction validationâ€‹.

**Node NFT holders** gain access to multiple benefits, including:

- **Staking rewards** through transaction fees and a share of 15% of the FUSE token supply.
- **Governance rights,** allowing participants to vote on protocol upgrades and ecosystem development.
- **Access to early features** and airdrops within the ecosystem.
- **Priority in future token sales and strategic partner collaborationsâ€‹**

The Node Sale strategy includes offering both whole and fractionalized node licenses to ensure broad accessibility and geographical distribution, fostering a robust and diverse validator communityâ€‹
