# Fuse Ember Node Sale

The Fuse Ember Node Sale went live on **February 11, 2025**.

In preparation for the launch of the zkEVM-powered Fuse Ember L2 in Q2 2025, we are offering up to 12,000 exclusive node licenses to the Fuse community. Nodes will secure the network, processing up to 9,000 transactions per second, while earning a share of ecosystem fees and early adopter incentives. 

As a node operator, you'll also play a key role in governance, helping to determine the future of blockchain-powered business payments. This is a chance to own a stake in a growing ecosystem built for real-world adoption. Once these 12,000 licenses are gone, no further nodes will be sold, making this a unique opportunity for the Fuse community and other investors to become a pivotal part of Fuse's zkEVM-powered ecosystem.

Key features of the Fuse Ember network include:

* Global payments with effortless integration.
* High throughput (9,000 tps) and low fees of $0.0001/tx
* AI agents for businesses
* ZK payments for mainstream usage
* Vertically-integrated open source stack
* Full mobile compatibility
* Recurring payments


# Node Pricing

Node sale participants will purchase NFTs that grant them a share of Fuse Ember emissions and fees, plus governance voting rights. The NFT will be non-transferable for the first year.

The first 2,000 nodes will be sold at a discounted price of $315, with successive tranches rising to $2,500. Tier 1 nodes are exclusively limited to FUSE holders.
