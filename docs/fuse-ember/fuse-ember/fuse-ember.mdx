Fuse is evolving!

Designed for business adoption, Fuse has proven to be a major success story. Since its launch in September 2019, the network has supported over 135 million transactions at an average cost of $0.0001, and currently hosts more than 150 different projects and integrations.

Now, it’s time to take the next step: Fuse Ember.

The coming wave of blockchain adoption requires a step-change in scaling capacity, as well as new features like privacy – a prerequisite for large-scale business use. Our focus is to enable new use cases and business models, while ensuring seamless integration between different decentralized services.

To achieve this, we are transitioning the core Fuse network to a layer-2 network built on Polygon CDK. Some of the benefits of this approach include:

- Even lower costs and higher throughput, nearing our goal of supporting 9,000 transactions per second (tps). This rivals the throughput of Web2 payments giants like VISA.
- Zero-knowledge technology both provides greater efficiency and builds privacy into the network at the protocol level.
- A high degree of flexibility allows businesses to customize the technology for their specific needs.
- Integration with Polygon CDK offers seamless interoperability between Fuse Ember and other Polygon chains, allowing the free movement of liquidity around the ecosystem.

Overall, Fuse Ember will provide the ideal blockchain infrastructure for small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as larger institutions, to enter the Web3 space.

For the foreseeable future, the existing Fuse network and the new Fuse Ember L2 will continue to exist concurrently.
