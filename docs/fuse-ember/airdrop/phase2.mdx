# Developer Grants

Ember Flow is Fuse Networkâ€™s new grants program. The program is designed to accelerate app development, user growth, and long-term engagement on Fuse. It rewards developer teams through a points-based system - Flow Points - that can be redeemed for FUSE tokens.

* Total Program Allocation: 60,000,000 FUSE (\~$200,000 USD)
* Season 1 Duration: Until January, 2025
* Redemption Rate: 1 Flow Point = 10 FUSE
* Season 1 Flow Points Available: 6,000,000


Goals
-----

* Incentivize long-term, ecosystem-aligned dev teams
* Reward real on-chain and social activity
* Ensure transparent and fair distribution

## Who Itâ€™s For

Season 1 is designed for projects building in the following categories:

| Category             | Weight |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| Bridges              | 5      |
| Lending / CDPs       | 4      |
| Yield / Tokenization | 4      |
| Spot & CLOB DEXs     | 4      |
| Derivatives / Perps  | 3      |
| GambleFi             | 3      |
| Gaming               | 2      |
| Fixed Yield          | 2      |
| Tooling / Payments   | 1      |

(Higher weight = more Flow Points)

## How It Works

Points are calculated based on:

* Performance Metrics: On-chain activity, growth, retention
* Category Weight: As above
* Fuse Exclusivity: Native apps get a boost
* Distribution Practices: Preference for teams sharing rewards transparently



Formula:
Final Flow Points = (App Score / Total App Scores) \* Season Allocation

Revocation Criteria
Points can be revoked if teams:

* Use rewards to pump tokens/NFTs
* Mislead users or distribute non-transparently
* Misrepresent their use of FUSE


## Example Scenarios

* Top Lending App (strong metrics, transparent dist.): 250K Points â†’ 2.5M FUSE
* New DEX (moderate metrics, fair incentives): 50K Points â†’ 500K FUSE
