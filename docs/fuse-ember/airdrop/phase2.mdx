# Builder Grants

We're allocating a total of **3.12 million FUSE** to the second phase of the Fuse Ember airdrop! This will be a bounty program designed to attract and reward developers who build apps on Flash, the new Ember testnet, before migration to the new Ember mainnet. 

Successful applicants will receive an initial tranche of tokens as a grant, with the remaining portion being disbursed in several further tranches, to be distributed as rewards to their users.

## Description

Builder Grants is a developer-focused phase of the airdrop campaign. As an incentive mechanism for developers in the Ember ecosystem, we want to reward apps for driving user engagement and innovation based on their performance on Ember.

The prize pool of each winner will be divided into 2 parts:

1. **Grant.** 20% of the total will be transferred to the application developer after the application is migrated to the Ember mainnet.
2. **User incentives.** The remaining 80% of the grant will be allocated to incentivize users of the application, and will be transferred to developers in several tranches. Each new tranche will be transferred after confirmation that the previous one was spent as intended.

This distribution system empowers apps to kickstart growth and maintain long-term user activity by encouraging consistent interaction and participation.

### App Categories

The program covers a wide range of categories, encouraging diverse and innovative apps. Multiple winners will be selected in each category, which include:

1. **Payments**, such as debit cards that support FUSE and USDC.
2. **Stablecoins**, including CDP stablecoins, yield-bearing stablecoins, and RWA-backed stablecoins.
3. **Yield**: Fixed yield, yield aggregators, and cross-chain yield tokenization.
4. **Gaming**: Prediction markets, single-click games, and gamified NFT apps.
5. **Tooling**. Vote incentive markets, and liquid locker protocols.
6. **Lending**. This may include simple lending markets and isolated lending markets.
7. **Community Movements**. Brand ambassador campaigns and user-engagement campaigns.
8. **Exchanges**: Perpetual markets, options markets, AMMs, and CLOB exchanges.
9. **DePIN & AI**: Wireless networks, energy grids, computation, and storage.

### Assessment Criteria

Apps will be judged on factors such as uniqueness, usability, and their potential to attract users and liquidity to Fuse Ember.

1. **Concept**: The novelty and value provided to end-users.
2. **Execution**: Quality of design, implementation, and functionality.
3. **Impact**: Potential impact on the L2 Ember network ecosystem.
4. **Users Incentive Strategy**: The likely effectiveness of the strategy for using the tokens that Fuse will allocate to the application to attract and incentivize its users.

### Key requirements

1. Projects must be deployed on the Flash testnet, with a working frontend.
2. Projects must be deployed on the Ember mainnet within the first week of the Ember mainnet launch.

### Fuse Team Support

Once the app has been deployed to the Flash testnet, the Fuse team may consider creating a new quest based on the app to help developers onboard users and perform load testing.
