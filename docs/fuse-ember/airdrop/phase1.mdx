# Explore The Fuse Ecosystem And Attract Liquidity

We're airdropping a total of **2.08 million FUSE** tokens to attract new users and liquidity to the existing L1 Fuse Network, in preparation for migration to the new Ember L2! You'll be able to earn points by inviting other users to follow our social accounts, and by interacting with different apps on the network.

Points will be distributed across multiple different campaigns, each of which will take the form of a series of quests, and can be redeemed for FUSE tokens when the L2 Ember mainnet launches.

## Quests

1. Follow Fuse on our socials: X, Telegram, and Discord
2. Join email wait list
3. Invite a friend
4. Explore the Volt app
5. Explore Voltage DEX
6. Explore Artrific NFT Marketplace
7. Explore GoodDollar
8. Explore Meridian Finance
9. Explore Charge
10. Bridge funds to Fuse
11. Voltage: Provide liquidity on any v3 pool
12. Voltage: Stake FUSE, VOLT, USDC or WETH
13. Lend on Meridian Finance
14. Borrow on Meridian Finance

Rewards for this phase will be distributed according to a vesting and burning mechanism, designed to prevent large amounts of FUSE tokens suddenly being added to the circulating supply.
