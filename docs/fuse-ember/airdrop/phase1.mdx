# Explore The Fuse Ecosystem And Attract Liquidity By Completing Quests

**Launch date: 9 January 2025**

The purpose of Phase 1 is to attract new and existing users and liquidity to the L1 Fuse Network through invitations to follow Fuse's social network accounts and by interacting with key apps built on Fuse. A total of 2.6 million FUSE is allocated to this phase.

During this stage of the campaign, users earn points, which can later be redeemed for FUSE tokens on the L2 Ember mainnet. Points are distributed across multiple seasons.

1. Follow Fuse on our socials: X, Telegram, and Discord
2. Join email wait list
3. Invite a friend
4. Explore the Volt app
5. Explore Voltage DEX
6. Explore Artrific NFT Marketplace

Airdropped rewards for this phase will be distributed according to a vesting and burning mechanism, designed to prevent large amounts of FUSE tokens suddenly being added to the circulating supply.
