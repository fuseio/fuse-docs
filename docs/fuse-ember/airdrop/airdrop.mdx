To incentivize the migration from L1 Fuse Network to the new L2 Fuse Ember chain, Fuse will be airdropping a total of 13 million FUSE tokens to different platform stakeholders. The airdrop will include four phases, with tokens being distributed using a points system for users and developers:

**Phase 1**: User-focused quests focusing on the existing L1 Fuse Network. **2.6 million FUSE** (20% of total airdrop reward allocation).

**Phase 2**: Developer-focused airdrop. **3.9 million FUSE** (30%).

**Phase 3**: User-focused quests on the L2 Flash Network. **1.3 million FUSE** (10%).

**Phase 4**: FUSE token migration incentive. **5.2 million FUSE** (40%).

## Airdrop Distribution: Vesting And Burning

For the user-focused airdrop phases #1 and #3, a system of vesting and burning has been designed to prevent the sudden release of large amounts of FUSE into the circulating supply, which could create downwards pressure on the token price.

On the first day of the airdrop, 25% of a user's token allocation will immediately become available. Users can claim this 25% immediately. The remaining 75% is vested over 270 days. Users can choose when to claim the rest of their allocation. However, claiming before the end of the 270-day term will cause a percentage of tokens to be burned, and the earlier they claim, the larger the burned percentage will be.

This motivates recipients to increase their on-chain activity while waiting longer to claim their airdrop. It also penalizes those who decide to claim their airdrop before it fully matures.

| Day     | Burn Amount |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 0-30    | 100%-88.9%  |
| 31-60   | 88.9%-77.8% |
| 61-90   | 77.8%-66.7% |
| 91-120  | 66.7%-55.6% |
| 121-150 | 55.6%-444%  |
| 151-180 | 44.4%-33.4% |
| 180-210 | 33.4%-22.3% |
| 211-240 | 22.3%-11.2% |
| 241-270 | 11.2%-0%    |

### Examples

1. Mark earns 1,000 FUSE tokens in the Fuse Ember airdrop. Mark can claim his 25% allocation at any time and receive 250 FUSE in his wallet. 90 days pass and Mark returns to the claim portal, deciding he would like the rest of his airdrop. As 90 days have passed by, he can claim 249.75 FUSE tokens (33.3% of the remaining 750 token allocation) but must burn 500.25 FUSE (66.7% of his locked allocation).
2. Mark earns 10,000 FUSE in the Fuse Ember airdrop. Mark can claim his 25% allocation at any time and receive 2,500 FUSE. Mark is excited to use his FUSE in the ecosystem and decides he would like all of his eligible airdrop allocation after day 30. Mark claims again (the final 75% portion), receiving 1,110 FUSE and burning 6,667.5 FUSE (88.9% of the final portion).
