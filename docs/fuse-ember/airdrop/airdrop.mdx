To incentivize the migration from L1 Fuse Network to the new L2 Fuse Ember chain, Fuse will be airdropping a total of 13 million FUSE tokens to different platform stakeholders. The airdrop will include four phases, with tokens being distributed using a points system for users and developers:

Phase 1: User-focused quests focusing on the existing L1 Fuse Network. 2.6 million FUSE (20% of total airdrop reward allocation).

Phase 2: Developer-focused airdrop. 3.9 million FUSE (30%)

Phase 3: User-focused quests on the L2 Flash Network. 1.3 million FUSE (10%)

Phase 4: FUSE token migration incentive. 5.2 million FUSE (40%)
