# Developer Grants Program

Ember Flow is a new grants program by Fuse Network, designed to accelerate developer adoption, user growth, and long-term retention across the ecosystem. Through Flow Points, developer teams can earn rewards for building apps that drive meaningful on-chain and social engagement.

The Developer Flow element of the program is backed by 60,000,000 FUSE tokens, to be distributed over three seasons. Season 1 will run until Q1 2026.




What are Ember Points? Ember Points are reward points earned by teams building on Fuse. Points are allocated based on app category, performance metrics, user engagement, and community alignment.

At the end of each season, developer teams can redeem Flow Points for FUSE tokens. 

The system is designed to:

* Incentivize teams that build long-term value.


* Reward meaningful user engagement.


* Create a competitive but fair distribution structure.



Eligibility 

Projects building in the following categories can participate:

| Category             | Weight |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| Bridges              | 5      |
| Lending / CDPs       | 4      |
| Yield / Tokenization | 4      |
| Spot & CLOB DEXs     | 4      |
| Derivatives / Perps  | 3      |
| RWA                  | 3      |
| Payments             | 3      |
| Fixed Yield          | 2      |

Higher weight means greater influence for final Flow Point scores.

How Flow Points Are Calculated 

Each app earns a score based on:

* Performance Metrics: On-chain activity, user growth, retention.


* Category Weight: See above table.


* Fuse Exclusivity: Apps built natively or primarily on Fuse receive a boost.


* Points calculation also takes into account time, TVL and actual usage.



Revocation Policy 

Flow Points may be revoked if a team:

* Uses FUSE rewards to pump their own token/NFT.


* Distributes rewards disproportionately or non-transparently.


* Misrepresents how rewards are being shared with users.
