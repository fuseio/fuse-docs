Ember Chain is a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain built on top of Ethereum to improve its scalability. While Ethereum processes around 15 transactions per second (TPS) with high gas fees, L2 solutions increase transaction throughput and reduce costs without compromising security or decentralization. By bundling many transactions into batches and posting them to Ethereum, L2 chains like Ember Chain benefit from Ethereumâ€™s security while enabling faster, cheaper transactions.

The Ember Chain is powered by Polygon CDK, and will combine scalability, security, and interoperability. By integrating advanced solutions like DAC for data availability, AggLayer for cross-chain communication, sequencer, and prover, Ember will deliver a fast, efficient, and secure Layer 2 blockchain. This setup allows for optimized capital efficiency and a seamless user experience while inheriting the security of Ethereum.

### zkRollup

As a zkRollup, Ember Chain uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify transaction batches. By posting only the validity proofs to Ethereum, Ember Chain ensures that all transactions are accurate without the need for re-execution on Ethereum, maintaining high security and efficiency.

### Polygon CDK

Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK) is a modular, open-source toolkit designed for building scalable, customizable, and secure L2 chains. It offers high flexibility, allowing the choice between zkEVM rollups for posting transaction data on Ethereum and validiums for optimized off-chain storage, making it a powerful solution for enhancing our chain ecosystem.
