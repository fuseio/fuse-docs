title: How To Set Up A Node On Linux
---

Experienced users may want to set up their own Fuse Ember Node on a Linux system. The following instructions are provided as a guideline only, and information may be incomplete or out of date. Ensure that you back up your data before starting. You can read the official Fuse Checker Node documentation or contact Fuse support for more information.

**1. Generate a burner wallet**

Start by creating a new wallet with a random seed phrase, using a service like [https://chaintool.tech/generateWallet/evmWallet](https://chaintool.tech/generateWallet/evmWallet) or [https://iancoleman.io/bip39/](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/). You can run these offline for better security.

2\. Delegate your node

Go to [Fuse testnet Nodes](https://console.fuse.io/nodes/testnet), connect your wallet containing your Fuse Node NFT, and delegate it to the wallet address you generated.

**3. **Set up your VPS

There are lots of VPS providers to choose from, but you should ensure you select at least the minimum hardware requirements, and ideally more: 

Minimum:

* CPU with 1+ cores
* 2 GB RAM
* 4 MBit/sec download speed

Recommended:

* Fast CPU with 2+ cores
* 4 GB+ RAM
* 8+ MBit/sec download speed

This guide uses Hostinger, with a KVM 2 setup, which provides 2 vCPU cores.
