title: How To Set Up A Node On Linux
---

Experienced users may want to set up their own Fuse Ember Node on a Linux system. The following instructions are provided as a guideline only, and information may be incomplete or out of date. Ensure that you back up your data before starting. You can read the official Fuse Checker Node documentation or contact Fuse support for more information.

**1. Generate a burner wallet**

Start by creating a new wallet with a random seed phrase, using a service like [https://chaintool.tech/generateWallet/evmWallet](https://chaintool.tech/generateWallet/evmWallet) or [https://iancoleman.io/bip39/](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/). You can run these offline for better security.

Once you have generated a new mnemonic, private key, and address, you can export these by clicking Download, or copy and paste them.

2\. Delegate your node

Go to [Fuse testnet Nodes](https://console.fuse.io/nodes/testnet), connect your wallet containing your Fuse Node NFT, and delegate it to the wallet address you generated.

**3. **Set up your VPS

There are lots of VPS providers to choose from, but you should ensure you select at least the minimum hardware requirements, and ideally more: 

Minimum:

* CPU with 1+ cores
* 2 GB RAM
* 4 MBit/sec download speed

Recommended:

* Fast CPU with 2+ cores
* 4 GB+ RAM
* 8+ MBit/sec download speed

This guide uses Hostinger, with a KVM 2 setup, which provides 2 vCPU cores.

Select Ubuntu to run the Fuse client.

After setup, go to the VPS Terminal.

4\. Update System and Install Dependencies

Make sure everything is up to date by running the following code in the terminal:

<CodeBlock language="Bash">
  \# Update system packages

  apt-get update

  \# Install required dependencies including libssl1.1

  apt-get install -y wget tar

  \# Install libssl1.1 (required by the binary)

  echo "deb http\://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/focal-security.list

  apt-get update

  apt-get install -y libssl1.1
</CodeBlock>

You should see a response like the following:

5\. Create directory and download the Fuse Ember client

<CodeBlock language="Bash">
  \# Create directory for the client

  mkdir -p \~/fuse-light && cd \~/fuse-light

  \# Download the pre-built binary

  wget https\://github.com/fuseio/avail-light/releases/download/v1.0.4/fuse-light-client-v1.0.4.tar.gz

  \# Extract the archive

  tar -xzf fuse-light-client-v1.0.4.tar.gz

  \# Check what files were extracted

  ls -la
</CodeBlock>

You should see a response as follows:

6\. Create your configuration file

<CodeBlock language="Bash">
  \# Create config file with only the required fields

  cat > config.yaml \<\< EOF

  sync\_start\_block = 1

  genesis\_hash = "DEVTST"

  avail\_path = "avail\_path"

  avail\_secret\_key = "bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk//Alice"

  check\_nft\_interval=300

  check\_nft\_endpoint="https\://monitoring.avail.fuse.io/check-nft"

  commission\_rate = "10"

  operator\_name = "SELF\_RUN"

  reward\_collector\_address = "0xYOUR\_REWARD\_ADDRESS"

  private\_key = "0xYOUR\_PRIVATE\_KEY"

  EOF
</CodeBlock>

For reward\_collector\_address you should set whatever address you want to receive rewards, while private\_key should be the private key from the wallet you created in step 1. Your NFT is delegated to this wallet.

7\. Make Binary executable

<CodeBlock language="Bash">
  \# Make the binary executable

  chmod +x avail-light-client
</CodeBlock>
