NodeOps is a Web3 platform designed to simplify and streamline blockchain node operations, making it easier for users to participate in decentralized ecosystems.

Fuse Ember node licence holders can use NodeOps to deploy their nodes, without the need for specialized hardware or deep technical knowledge. NodeOps manages setting up servers, maintaining uptime, and handling software updates automatically. This reduces barriers to participation, increasing decentralization and enhancing network reliability.
