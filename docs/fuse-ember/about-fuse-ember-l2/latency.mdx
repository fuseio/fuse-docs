Ember Chain is designed to handle high transaction throughput while maintaining low latency, making it suitable for applications that require fast and reliable performance, including **real-time payments**. The network is expected to comfortably support around 200 transactions per second (TPS), with the potential to scale up to 1,000 TPS, equivalent to 48 million gas per second.
