## Latency and real-time payment

Ember Chain is designed to handle high transaction throughput while maintaining low latency, making it suitable for applications that require fast and reliable performance. The network is expected to comfortably support around 200 transactions per second (TPS), with the potential to scale up to 1,000 TPS, equivalent to 48 million gas per second.
