title: New consensus Mechanism

At present, the Fuse Network blockchain relies on the AuRa consensus mechanism. It was originally developed for proof-of-authority blockchains, but the Fuse team successfully modified it to run one of the first delegated proof of stake (DPoS) forms.

It has enabled on-chain governance and delegated staking.

However, this approach is becoming incompatible with state-of-the-art in the blockchain space, spearheaded by the Ethereum PoS effort. For example, the liquid staking protocols on Ethereum are incompatible with Fuse Network due to the different consensus models.

Hence, we are planning to upgrade the Fuse consensus mechanism and bring it in line with the industry's best practices.
