# Bridge to Other Chains

Currently, the following cross-chain bridges enable the transfers of digital assets between Fuse and other major blockchains.

## Fuse Bridge

It can be accessed via the Fuse Tool called [Console](https://console.fuse.io/bridge). Console contains a Bridge which allows users to move funds from different networks and centralized exchanges to Fuse. The Bridge connects Fuse Network to Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism and BNB Chains. It supports the transfers of significant assets, including FUSE, USDC, USDT, BNB, BUSD, WETH, WBTC, and more. 

It also enables Bridging assets from Centralized Exchanges such as: Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin and Huobi Global.

## Elk Finance

[Elk Finance](https://elk.finance/) is a multichain bridge through which only its native ELK token is transferred. Users can move from an asset on one chain to another by exchanging the starting asset on Elk DEX for ELK, transferring ELK to the destination chain, and then purchasing the desired asset.&#x20;

Elk Finance supports a range of significant chains that, in addition to Fuse Network, includes Avalanche C-Chain, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Fantom, Polygon, and others.&#x20;
