# Fuse Bridge FAQ

### I have USDC or WETH on the Fuse network and want to bridge it to another network. But the Bridge shows me a balance of 0.

- The Fuse Bridge uses other tokens USDC V2 and WETH V2 on the bridge. Don't worry, their value is identical to standard USDC and WETH on the Fuse network.

- So first you need to swap your USDC/WETH tokens for USDC V2/WETH V2 on the [Voltage Finance dapp](https://app.voltage.finance/#/swap) and then bridge tokens from Fuse to another network. 

### I deposited USDC or WETH into the Fuse network, but I don't see the tokens in my wallet.

- By depositing USDC or WETH into the Fuse network, you receive new tokens which exist specifically for the bridge. Therefore, to see them in your wallet, you need to add them. You can use the "**Add Token**" button or add them manually using the contract address.

- USDC V2 contract address: [0x28c3d1cd466ba22f6cae51b1a4692a831696391a](https://explorer.fuse.io/token/0x28C3d1cD466Ba22f6cae51b1a4692a831696391A/token-transfers)

- WETH V2 contract address: [0x5622f6dc93e08a8b717b149677930c38d5d50682](https://explorer.fuse.io/token/0x5622F6dC93e08a8b717B149677930C38d5d50682/token-transfers)

After that, you can swap these tokens for standard USDC and WETH on Fuse on the [Voltage](https://app.voltage.finance/#/swap) Finance dapp.

### What are Fuse token addresses on Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum?

- Optimistic (OP): [0xe453d6649643F1F460C371dC3D1da98F7922fe51](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xe453d6649643f1f460c371dc3d1da98f7922fe51)

- Arbitrum (ARB): [0x6b021b3f68491974bE6D4009fEe61a4e3C708fD6](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6b021b3f68491974be6d4009fee61a4e3c708fd6)

- Polygon (MATIC): [0x6b021b3f68491974bE6D4009fEe61a4e3C708fD6](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x6b021b3f68491974be6d4009fee61a4e3c708fd6)

### What tokens can be transferred using the Fuse Token Bridge?

- The Fuse Token Bridge can send FUSE, USDC, and WETH tokens.

### Between which networks can the tokens be transferred?

- The tokens can be transferred between the Fuse Network and Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.

### Is there a guide available on how to use the Fuse Token Bridge?

- Yes, a guide on how to use the Fuse Token Bridge is available on the provided [link](https://youtu.be/LUsoAdsTWM4?si=LuOxRsTlMZ9RSsHh).

### What is the Native Token of the Fuse Network?

- The native token of the Fuse Network is the Fuse token (FUSE).

### What technology powers the Fuse bridge, and who monitors its security?

- The token bridge is powered by LayerZero technology, and its security is monitored by blockchain security experts Ironblocks.

### Are there any fees associated with using the Fuse Token Bridge?

- Currently, there are zero bridge fees on the Fuse Token Bridge.

### Is there any liquidity concern users should know?

- Users should be aware that liquidity at this stage is minimal, so they are advised to avoid trying to bridge substantial amounts.

### How are gas fees on Fuse Network calculated?

- Blockchain gas fees are calculated based on the complexity of the transaction or contract interaction on the network. Every operation, such as sending tokens, interacting with a contract, or transferring assets, requires a certain amount of computational work measured in "gas."

- The total gas fee is determined by multiplying the gas used by the gas price, which is set by the user and measured in units like gwei for Ethereum.

### I had FUSE tokens on the Polygon network, but after I withdrew the FUSE tokens from the Fuse network, I received other FUSE tokens. What's happening?

- Don't worry, both tokens are valid, but one of them is deprecated and no longer used in the bridge.

- Deprecated FUSE token on Polygon: [0xF915fDDa4c882731C0456a4214548Cd13A822886](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xF915fDDa4c882731C0456a4214548Cd13A822886)

- New FUSE token on Polygon: [0x6b021b3f68491974bE6D4009fEe61a4e3C708fD6](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x6b021b3f68491974be6d4009fee61a4e3c708fd6)

- Just swap the deprecated tokens for new ones. This can be done directly in MetaMask, for instance, or in any other dapp.
