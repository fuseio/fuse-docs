# About Fuse

Fuse is an Ethereum-compatible platform designed to improve access to Web3 technology for businesses and developers by simplifying payments and blockchain transactions. 

Fuse is suited to all types of enterprise users, from Web2 companies that want to integrate blockchain functionality into their apps, through to Web3-native projects.

Like other public blockchains, Fuse is open, decentralized, and permissionless. Anyone can make transactions, anyone can run a validating node to help secure the network, and anyone can build applications with Fuse’s technology, without restriction. 

As an EVM-compatible platform, applications deployed on other Ethereum-based chains work seamlessly on Fuse. Additionally, the Fuse network and ecosystem offer a number of features to ensure a user-friendly developer experience, including account abstraction, an extensive SDK, and powerful APIs. Fast confirmation times (\<5s) and very low transaction costs (around $0.0001 per tx) make Fuse suitable for applications of all kinds: gaming, social, payments, DeFi, and more.

FUSE is the native token of the network. New FUSE tokens are issued with every block added to the network, and can be used to pay gas fees, similar to Ether (ETH) on Ethereum. 

The Fuse network will ultimately transition to Fuse Ember, a layer-2 platform based on Polygon CDK. This will offer even higher throughput, lower costs, greater privacy, and enhanced liquidity through frictionless interoperability with other Polygon chains.
