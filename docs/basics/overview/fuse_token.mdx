The network’s native token is the Fuse Token (FUSE). This is used in several ways within the ecosystem, including:

**Transaction fees:** As FUSE is the native currency of the Fuse Network blockchain, users must pay transaction fees (gas) in FUSE.

**Payments:** As the native currency, sending FUSE does not require interactions with smart contracts. FUSE transfers therefore generally require lower transaction fees than ERC-20 transfers.

**Validation:** Token holders can stake FUSE to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100,000 FUSE. While the network is continuously growing, there are currently 60+ validators.

**Voting:** Validators can vote on protocol changes with their staked FUSE and with the tokens delegated to them by stakers. This means validators with a larger amount of FUSE staked or delegated have greater voting rights on network upgrades and governance changes.

**Staking:** FUSE holders can choose one or more validators to delegate and stake their tokens. They receive a share of the Fuse block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).

### FUSE Tokenomics​

With each new block created every 5 seconds on Fuse Network, the validator who creates it and the delegators who staked with them receive the block rewards in newly issued FUSE tokens. This is designed to secure the network's [consensus mechanism](https://docs.fuse.io/aboutFuse/about-fuse/fuse-network-blockchain/fuse-consensus).&#x20;

The reward amount per block is set so that the FUSE total supply increases by 5% yearly.

The main reason for choosing an inflationary model at the early development stage was to ensure certain predictability of the flow of revenue for network validators and delegators.&#x20;

If they had to rely exclusively on transaction fees as the reward for staking FUSE and validating, it would be harder to predict their future returns, as transaction activity on the network can fluctuate.

The relative predictability of validator revenue is an essential assumption behind the blockchain consensus theory on which the Fuse consensus mechanism is based. &#x20;

Having substantial block rewards also makes it possible to keep transaction fees on the network low, facilitating the adoption of Fuse.

As was mentioned in the Intro to Fuse section, the upcoming transition to Fuse V2 will also involve the implementation of new tokenomics for the FUSE token described in the [Fuse V2](../fuse-v2-next-chapter/) section.

### Where to buy FUSE

#### CEXes

Centralized exchanges (CEXes) facilitate the trading, buying, and selling of various cryptocurrencies. These platforms operate as an intermediary between users by providing a centralized online marketplace where participants can exchange digital assets for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency.

You can buy FUSE from the centralized exchanges listed below:

| CEX                                                                                 |

| [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/en/price/fuse-fuse)                                   |
| [Huobi Global](https://www.htx.com/en-us/asset-introduction/details/?currency=fuse) |
| [MEXC Global](https://www.mexc.com/price/FUSE)                                      |
| [AscendEX](https://ascendex.com/en/cashtrade-spottrading/usdt/fuse)                 |

#### DEXes

A DEX (decentralized exchange) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where users can trade cryptocurrencies in a non-custodial manner, without the need for an intermediary to facilitate the transfer and custody of funds. DEXs substitute intermediaries—traditionally, banks, brokers, payment processors, or other institutions—with blockchain-based smart contracts.

You can swap FUSE using the decentralized exchanges listed below:

| DEX                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- |
| [Fluxswap](https://app.fluxswap.io/)            |

| [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap) |
| [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/)      |

| [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/)             |
| [Voltage](https://voltage.finance/swap)         |

#### Fiat On-Ramps

Fiat on-ramps and off-ramps are services that facilitate the exchange of fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies and tokens such as FUSE, USDC or USDT, and vice versa. There are several types of fiat on-ramps and off-ramps, including platforms for cryptocurrency transactions, peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, brokerage services, and payment processors. Each type caters to different user needs.

More information about FUSE trading volumes and prices on various exchanges can be found on the [FUSE token CoinMarketCap page](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fuse-network/).

### Yield Farming FUSE Token

The project team occasionally uses the FUSE token to power liquidity reward (yield farming) programs to boost liquidity on DEXes and participation in the Fuse Lending Network.

The ongoing liquidity rewards programs on DEXes can be found [here](https://app.voltage.finance/index.html#/farm/122).

## FUSE On Other Blockchains

One way to ensure the growth of Fuse and its prospects is by enabling additional versions (wrappers) of FUSE on other chains. These wrapped FUSE take the form of ERC-20 tokens.

Wrapped versions of the FUSE token exist on Ethereum (mainnet), Binance Smart Chain, the Arbitrum One layer-2 optimistic rollup chain for Ethereum, and Optimism. The latter is a wrapper of a wrapper powered by the Ethereum-Arbitrum bridge, and its withdrawals from Arbitrum are subject to the optimistic rollup rules.

You can add these to your Web3 wallet using the below networks and contracts:

| Network      | Fuse Contract                                                                                |
