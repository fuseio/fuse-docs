The network’s utility token is the Fuse Token (FUSE) - an ERC-20 token with several utilities within the ecosystem, including:

**Payments:** As FUSE is the native currency on Fuse Network, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, FUSE transfers are potentially faster and less costly regarding transaction fees.

**Transaction fees:** Being the native currency on the Fuse Network blockchain, users must pay fees in FUSE to approve transactions.

**Validation:** Token holders can stake FUSE to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K FUSE. While the network is continuously growing, there are currently 60+ validators.

**Voting:** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked FUSE and with the tokens delegated to them by stakers. This means validators with higher amounts of Fuse staked can have a more significant vote on network upgrades and governance changes.

**Staking:** FUSE holders can choose one or more validators to delegate and stake their tokens. They receive a share of the Fuse block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).

### FUSE Tokenomics​

The team proposed changes to the tokenomics of the Fuse Network in early 2023 through [FRC002](https://news.fuse.io/max-supply-max-potential-the-journey-of-fuse-token-to-a-sustainable-future/). Most importantly, it outlines the importance of [transitioning FUSE to a deflationary model](https://forum.fuse.io/t/frc02-setting-a-max-supply-introducing-fee-burn-and-transitioning-to-a-deflationary-model/633), fee burning, and setting a maximum supply for the [FUSE tokens](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/fuse).

In August 2024 - these changes are expected to be implemented on the consensus level.

DEXs substitute intermediaries—traditionally, banks, brokers, payment processors, or other institutions—with blockchain-based smart contracts that facilitate the exchange of assets.

## FUSE On Other Blockchains

One way to ensure the growth of Fuse and its prospects is by enabling additional versions (wrappers) of FUSE on other chains.

Wrapped versions of the FUSE token exist on Ethereum (mainnet), Binance Smart Chain, and the Arbitrum One layer-2 optimistic rollup chain for Ethereum, and Optimism. The latter is a wrapper of a wrapper powered by the Ethereum-Arbitrum bridge, and its withdrawals from Arbitrum are subject to the optimistic rollup rules.

You can add these to your Web3 wallet using the below networks and contracts:
