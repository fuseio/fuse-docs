# The Fuse Network Ecosystem

As an open source, decentralized blockchain platform, Fuse relies on a global community of contributors to function, grow, and thrive. Find out more about the different stakeholders in the Fuse ecosystem, and how you can contribute.

## Individuals

Fuse users can benefit from a wide range of tools and services created by the core Fuse team, by third-party developers within the Fuse ecosystem, and by organizations within the wider crypto space. These include wallets, bridges, and block explorers.

For the latest updates on Fuse, and to explore the community, [follow Fuse on X](https://x.com/Fuse_network) and [join our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jpPMeSZ).

## Validators and Staking

Validators maintain network security and process transactions. Find out the requirements for running a validating node, and how to get set up.

Validators can also participate in Fuseâ€™s open governance process by voting on Fuse Improvement Proposals (FIPs).

FUSE holders can stake or delegate their tokens to validating nodes to earn a share of rewards, contribute to network security, and to support FIPs.

## Building on Fuse

Developers will find extensive tools and tutorials to help them get started and build powerful applications on the Fuse network.
