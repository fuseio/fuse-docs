Click here for a complete step-by-step guide to adding Fuse to MetaMask. Alternatively, manually add the information below to your MetaMask wallet.

The standard way for users to connect to the Fuse Network blockchain is with a blockchain wallet like Metamask:

- Network name: **Fuse Network**
- ChanId: **122**
- Gas price: **10 gwei**
- RPC: **https://rpc.fuse.io/, or any other from the list**
- Native token: **FUSE**
- Explorer: **https://explorer.fuse.io/**

The process is the same if another wallet requires adding Fuse Network manually, although sometimes less information may be required.

Some wallets also support adding the Fuse Network via tools like Chainlist.
