## ðŸŒ‰ Transferring tokens from Ethereum to Fuse network

In this step-by-step bridging tutorial, we will use a [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io/download/) to bridge FUSE tokens from **Ethereum network to Fuse** via the native [app.voltage.finance](https://app.voltage.finance/#/bridge) bridge.

<Admonition type="info" title="Bridging funds between Fuse and Ethereum networks is a 2-step process:">

1. **Token transfer** - transferring tokens between Fuse and Ethereum.
2. **Token claim** - claiming your tokens after transferring to Fuse or Ethereum network.

**Step 1:** Navigate to [app.voltage.finance/#/bridge:](https://app.voltage.finance/#/bridge)

**Step 2:** Press **Connect wallet** on the right-hand top corner of the page to connect your wallet to the [Voltage Finance](https://app.voltage.finance/) DApp.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
  Once you connect, you should be able to see your wallet address and the
  network you are currently connected to - in this case, make sure you are
  connected to ***Ethereum network***.

**Step 3: Choose a token** from the dropdown token menu and **enter the amount** you want to transfer from Ethereum to Fuse network and **click the Bridge** button. Approve transaction on the MetaMask.

**Step 4:** Now **switch to Fuse network** on your MetaMask wallet, and you will see the tokens on your wallet.

**Step 5: Congratulations!** ðŸŽ‰ Your tokens were successfully bridged from EthereumFuse to Ethereum network!

<Admonition type="info" title="ðŸ›  AMB bridge tools for manual token claiming: ">
  In case you have closed the claiming tab, didn't receive the UI message to claim your tokens, or didn't have enough ETH to pay for gas - **you can use the following debugging tool links** to **manually claim** the tokens on the Fuse and Ethereum bridge:

- [amb.fuse.io](https://amb.fuse.io) - track the status of your bridge transactions
- [alm.fuse.io](https://alm.fuse.io) - manual claiming for ERC20 supported tokens (**except FUSE**)
- [fusealm.fuse.io](https://fusealm.fuse.io/) - manual claiming only for \*\*FUSE tokens \*\*
