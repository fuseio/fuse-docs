# Asset Bridges to Other Chains

Currently, the following cross-chain bridges enable the transfers of digital assets between Fuse and other major blockchains.&#x20;

## Fuse Bridge

It can be most easily accessed via the [user interface](https://app.voltage.finance/#/bridge) on Voltage Finance. The bridge connects Fuse Network to Ethereum and BNB Chains. It supports the transfers of significant assets, including FUSE, USDC, USDT, BNB, BUSD, WETH, WBTC, and more.&#x20;

## Elk Finance

[Elk Finance](https://elk.finance/) is a multichain bridge through which only its native ELK token is transferred. Users can move from an asset on one chain to another by exchanging the starting asset on Elk DEX for ELK, transferring ELK to the destination chain, and then purchasing the desired asset.&#x20;

Elk Finance supports a range of significant chains that, in addition to Fuse Network, includes Avalanche C-Chain, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Fantom, Polygon, and others.&#x20;

## Multichain

The [Multichain](https://multichain.org) Multichain bridge platform can transfer FUSE between Fuse and Polygon. It is also available for transferring three other tokens: agEUR (Angle), BIFI (Beefy Finance), and OLE (OpenLeverage).&#x20;

Although it nominally also supports ETH and USDC transfers, we advise against doing that as the canonical Fuse versions of those assets (with significant liquidity on the Fuse Network) are currently not supported.

## Chainge Finance

The [Chainge Finance](https://chainge.finance) bridge powered by the DCRM technology is accessible via the Chainge mobile app. Currently, it allows transferring FUSE between Fuse Network and Ethereum.&#x20;
