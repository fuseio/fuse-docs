# Sending a State-Changing UserOp for a Smart Contract Wallet using Fusebox Web SDK

## Introduction:

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the Fuse Web SDK to send a Fuse Blockchain state-changing UserOp for a Smart Contract Wallet. The provided code example demonstrates how to interact with a smart contract on the Fuse blockchain using a gasless transaction.

## Prerequisites:

1. Node.js Installed: You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Code Editor: Use your preferred code editor; VS Code is recommended.
3. Fuse Wallet and API Key: Obtain a Fuse Wallet and API Key from the Fuse Console Dashboard.
4. A Fuse Console Gas Tank set up for the Paymaster.
5. Basic Understanding of JavaScript: Familiarity with JavaScript will be helpful.

## Step 1: Set up your Project

Create a new project folder and initialize it using Node.js:
```bash
mkdir new-project && cc new-project
npm init -y
```

Install the required packages:
```bash
npm install ethers@5.7.2 @fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk
```

## Step 2: Write the Code

Open your code editor and create a new file, e.g. `sendUserOp.mjs`.

Import Libraries and Initialize FuseSDK: Import the necessary libraries, including ethers for web3 access functionalities and FuseSDK for Fuse Network interactions.


```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { FuseSDK } from '@fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk';
```


## Step 3: Set Up Wallet Credential

```javascript
const credentials = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>);
const publicApiKey = process.env.<YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY> ;
```

Create a wallet using your private key and set up the public API key required for FuseSDK initialization. Make sure to keep your private key secure and never share it.

## Step 4: Initialize FuseSDK:

```javascript
const fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(publicApiKey, credentials, {
    withPaymaster: true,
});
```

Initialize the FuseSDK with your public API key, and wallet credentials, and enable the Paymaster for gasless transactions.

## Step 5: Specify Contract Information

```javascript
const contractAddress = "0xb8D4BD32d0c8C9012cF5E90D2acF37091a73B6F6"; // MTK Token Contract
const amount = ethers.utils.parseEther("0");
```

Specify the contract address and the amount (in Wei) for the transaction. In this example, we set the amount to 0, indicating a state-changing operation that does not involve transferring funds.

## Step 6: Encode Contract Call

```javascript
const contractCall = new ethers.utils.Interface([
    "function mint(uint256 amount)",
]);

const data = contractCall.encodeFunctionData("mint", [1]);
```

Create an interface for the smart contract function you want to call (in this case, `mint`), and encode the function data with the specified parameters. In this example, we pass the value 1 as the amount to mint.

## Step 7: Send Contract Call

```javascript
const res = await fuseSDK.callContract(contractAddress, amount, data);
```

Use the FuseSDK to send the contract call. The `callContract` function handles the gasless transaction and returns a response object containing the UserOpHash.

## Step 8: Monitor Transaction

```javascript
console.log(`UserOpHash: ${res?.userOpHash}`);
console.log("Waiting for transaction...");

const receipt = await res?.wait();
console.log("Transaction Hash:", receipt?.transactionHash);
```

Output the UserOpHash and wait for the transaction receipt. The UserOpHash uniquely identifies the gasless transaction, and the transaction hash is printed once the transaction is confirmed.

## Step 9: Running the Code

Save the file and open your terminal. Navigate to your project folder and run:

```bash
node sendUserOp.mjs
```

This will execute the script, and you should see output similar to:

```
UserOpHash: 0x1234567890abcdef...
Waiting for transaction...
Transaction Hash: 0x9876543210fedcba...
```

Congratulations! You've just sent a UserOp on the Fuse Blockchain using the Fuse Web SDK.


## Complete Code

const main = async () => {
    const credentials = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY);
    const publicApiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_API_KEY;
    const fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(publicApiKey, credentials, {
      withPaymaster: true,
    });
  
    // You can use any other "to" address and any other "value"
// MTK Token
    const contractAddress = "0xb8D4BD32d0c8C9012cF5E90D2acF37091a73B6F6"; Contract
    const amount = parseEther("0");

    const contractCall = new ethers.utils.Interface([
        "function mint(uint256 amount)",
      ]);

    const data = contractCall.encodeFunctionData("mint", [1]);

    const res = await fuseSDK.callContract(contractAddress, amount, data);
  
    console.log(`UserOpHash: ${res?.userOpHash}`);
    console.log("Waiting for transaction...");

    const receipt = await res?.wait();
    console.log("Transaction Hash:", receipt?.transactionHash);
    };

// Execute the main function
main();


## Conclusion:

Congratulations! You have successfully sent a Fuse blockchain state-changing UserOp for a Smart Account Wallet using the Fuse Web SDK. This example demonstrates a gasless transaction with a smart contract on the Fuse blockchain. Feel free to explore and modify the code for your specific use case.
