## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to submit your first transaction using a smart contract wallet. You'll be guided through setting up the necessary client with @fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk, creating a user operation, obtaining sponsorship from FuseBox's verifying paymaster, and finally submitting it on-chain using FuseBox's bundler.

### Obtain an API Key

To begin, navigate to our [Operator Dashboard](https://console.fuse.io/build) and generate an API key. This key is essential for accessing our services.

### Clone the FuseBox Tutorial Template Repository

To facilitate your start, we've prepared a [FuseBox tutorial template repository](https://github.com/fuseio/tutorial-template) equipped with Typescript, viem, and @fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk. Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up your environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fuseio/tutorial-template.git fusebox-tutorial
cd fusebox-tutorial
```

Proceed by installing the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

We'll mainly work with the `index.ts` file. Test your setup by running:

```bash
npm start
```

If set up correctly, you should see `Hello world!` printed in the console.

### Generate a Private Key

Generate a private key and store it securely. Use the following code snippet in `index.ts`:

```typescript
const privateKey =
  process.env.PRIVATE_KEY ??
  (() => {
    const pk = generatePrivateKey();
    writeFileSync(".env", `PRIVATE_KEY=${pk}`);
    return pk;
  })();
```

### Initialize the SDK

FuseSDK enables the creation of User Operations for ERC-4337 Etherspot Smart Account, Bundler service, or Paymaster. It's open source and MIT licensed, offering flexibility and no lock-in. Replace `YOUR_FUSEBOX_API_KEY` with your actual API key:

```typescript
const apiKey = "YOUR_FUSEBOX_API_KEY";
const credentials = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey);
const fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(apiKey, credentials);
```

### Create a smart contract wallet

Initialize the SDK with the previously generated private key to create the Etherspot Smart Account:

```typescript
console.log(
  `Smart account address: https://explorer.fuse.io/address/${fuseSDK.wallet.getSender()}`
);
```

Running this code will display the smart account address in the console. Note that the smart account is counterfactual and will be deployed on-chain when you send a transaction.

### Submit a Transaction

Now, let's submit a transaction from the smart account. We'll send a transaction to `0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045` (`vitalik.eth`) with `0x1234` as example call data. FuseSDK will handle the operations, including sponsorship and submission:

```typescript
const value = ethers.utils.parseEther("0");
const data = new TextEncoder().encode("0x1234");
const res = await fuseSDK.callContract(to, value, data);

console.log(`UserOpHash: ${res?.userOpHash}`);
console.log("Waiting for transaction...");

const receipt = await res?.wait();

console.log(
  `User operation included: https://explorer.fuse.io/tx/${receipt?.transactionHash}`
);
```

Upon running, you'll see the transaction hash and confirmation that your operation is on-chain.

Congratulations! You've successfully sent a transaction, deploying a smart account, verifying its signature, having the operation sponsored, and executing a transaction—all with just a few lines of code.
