# Introduction to ERC-1155 Tokens

The ERC-1155 token standard, proposed by Enjin, is a widely adopted standard on the Ethereum blockchain that allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within a single contract. Unlike its predecessors, ERC-20 and ERC-721, ERC-1155 offers significant improvements in efficiency, flexibility, and functionality.

## Key Features of ERC-1155

**1. Batch Transfers:** ERC-1155 enables batch transfers, allowing multiple token types to be transferred in a single transaction. This significantly reduces gas costs and optimizes contract interactions, making it more efficient than previous token standards.

**2. Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens:** ERC-1155 supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens within the same contract. This versatility allows developers to create various token types within a single contract, simplifying token management and deployment.

**3. Reduced On-Chain Footprint:** By bundling multiple token types into a single contract, ERC-1155 reduces the on-chain footprint compared to deploying separate contracts for each token type. This optimization leads to lower deployment costs and better scalability.

**4. Metadata Extension:** ERC-1155 includes a metadata extension, allowing developers to attach metadata to each token type. This metadata can include additional information such as token name, description, image URI, and other relevant attributes.

## Example Contract: GameItems

Let's take a look at a simple example of an ERC-1155 contract called `GameItems`. This contract mints two types of tokens: "Thors Hammer" (a non-fungible token) and "Gold" (a fungible token).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import {ERC1155} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";

contract GameItems is ERC1155 {
    uint256 public constant THORS_HAMMER = 0;
    uint256 public constant GOLD = 1;

    constructor() ERC1155("https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfPqxv1y1LLZdSwRftrr9FWLA4hPJ2mNfxUDS1wy5BRsH/0.json") {
        _mint(msg.sender, GOLD, 10**6, "");
        _mint(msg.sender, THORS_HAMMER, 100, "");
    }
}
```

In this contract:

- `THORS_HAMMER` and `GOLD` are defined as token IDs for the non-fungible and fungible tokens, respectively.
- Upon deployment, the contract mints 1,000,000 units of Gold and 100 units of Thor's Hammer to the contract deployer.
- The contract URI points to metadata stored on IPFS, providing additional information about the tokens.

To deploy the `GameItems` contract using Hardhat, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Initialize Hardhat

Create a new directory for your project and initialize a Hardhat project.

```bash
mkdir erc1155project $$ cd erc1155project
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

Initialize Hardhat in your project directory:

```bash
npx hardhat init
```

Follow the prompts and set up a javascript project:

## Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

Ensure you install the OpenZeppelin Contracts library:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

## Step 3: Write the Smart Contract

Create a new Solidity file named `GameItems.sol` in the `contracts` directory and paste the provided contract code above into it.


## Step 4: Compile the Smart Contract

To compile the contract run npx hardhat compile in your terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## Step 4: Deploy the Smart Contract

In Hardhat, deployments are defined through Ignition Modules. These modules are abstractions to describe a deployment; that is, JavaScript functions that specify what you want to deploy.

Open ignition inside the project root's directory, then, enter the directory named modules. Create a `deploy.js` and paste the following code:

```javascript
const { buildModule } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules");

const GameItems = buildModule("GameItems", (m) => {
  const contract = m.contract("GameItems");

  return { contract };
});

module.exports = GameItems;
```

## Step 5: Run Deployment
Update the hardhat.config.js file to include the network information:

```javascript
// hardhat.config.js
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.24",
  networks: {
    fuse: {
      url: `https://rpc.fuse.io`,
      accounts: [`0xPRIVATE_KEY`],
      gas: 2100000,
      gasPrice: 8000000000,
      saveDeployments: true,
    },
  },
};
```

Run the deployment script using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.js --network fuse
```

You've successfully deployed the `GameItems` contract using Hardhat. Now, you can interact with the deployed contract on the Fuse blockchain. 

## Example UI Interaction
If you have completed the UI guide for interacting with [ERC 721 NFTs using FuseBox](./mint-erc721-aa-part2), this guide is no different in the nature of the UI. What is highlighted here is the difference between interacting with the ERC721 and ERC-1155 by parsing a TokenID for ERC-1155. For example, calling the `safeTransfer()` method:

```javascript
const transfer = async () => {
  try {
    const mintTx = new ethers.Interface(["function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 value, data)"]);
        const from = “0xOwnerAddress”
    const to = "0xReceiverAddress";
    const id = “TokenID” //0 for Thor’s Hammer 1 for Gold
    const value = 1;
    const data = [];
    const txData = mintTx.encodeFunctionData("safeTransferFrom", (from, to, id, value, data));
    const finalData = Uint8Array.from([txData]);
    console.log(finalData);

    const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
    const signer = await provider.getSigner();

    const apiKey = "API_KEY";
    const fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(apiKey, signer);
    const res = await fuseSDK.callContract(to, value, finalData);

    console.log(`UserOpHash: ${res?.userOpHash}`);
    console.log("Waiting for transaction...");
    console.log("Transaction Hash:", receipt?.transactionHash);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
```

You can also send a Batch Transaction by passing an array of receiving addresses, and an array of the value of the token types they are to receive.

## Conclusion

ERC-1155 tokens offer a powerful and efficient solution for managing both fungible and non-fungible tokens on the Fuse blockchain. With features such as batch transfers, and metadata extension, ERC-1155 provides developers with the flexibility and scalability needed to build complex decentralized applications. As you explore ERC-1155 further, consider its various applications in gaming, digital collectibles, decentralized finance (DeFi), and more.
