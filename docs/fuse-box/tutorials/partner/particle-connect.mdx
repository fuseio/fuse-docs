title: Social Logins and Account Abstraction with Particle Connect
sidebar_position: 8
---

Particle Connect combines Social and Web3 logins with built-in Account Abstraction support, all within a single SDK. This approach allows you to simplify user onboarding while directly incorporating AA features into your **Fuse dApp**.

Integrating **Particle Connect** into your **Fuse** web application can be done in **under five minutes**.

This guide provides a concise overview of how to install, configure, and enable social logins in a Next.js application using `create @particle-network/connectkit` as your starting point. 

:::note
For a detailed explanation of each feature and more advanced configurations, refer to the [Particle Connect SDK reference](/api-reference/connect/desktop/web).

### Boilerplate: Initializing Particle Connect

The easiest way to get started with **Particle Connect** is through its built-in starter/boilerplate; this includes the core file setup and code structure needed to configure Particle Connect. 

To initialize this boilerplate, copy and execute one of the following commands.

```sh Terminal
npm init @particle-network/connectkit@latest
# or
pnpm create @particle-network/connectkit@latest
# or
yarn create @particle-network/connectkit
```

After running one of the aforementioned commands, the CLI will guide you through a setup process; it will prompt you to enter a project name, choose your preferred framework (Next.js or React), and select additional options.

```shell Terminal
ðŸ¤© Welcome to Particle Network!

âœ” What is the name of your project? â€¦ connectkit-aa-usage

âœ” What is the template of your project? â€º create-next-app
âœ” Which chains does your app support?â€‹ â€º EVM
âœ” Which ERC-4337 Contract does your app support?â€‹ â€º SIMPLE-2.0.0
âœ” Does it support an embedded wallet?â€‹ â€¦ yes
```

:::note
This guide will proceed with a **Next.js** project setup, although **React (create-react-app)** is also supported.

Additionally, Account Abstraction on Fuse is only supported through the `SIMPLE` instance of Smart Account.

### Configuring Particle Connect

With a starter project initialized, you're ready to configure Particle Connect through its core component, `ConnectKitProvider`. 

Before diving deeper, you'll need some keys from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).

**Particle Connect** requires three key values from the dashboard to be initiated: `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`.

### Access the Particle Dashboard

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

:::note
To get started, sign up or log in to the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).
:::

### Create a New Project or Use an Existing One

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="new-project" label="New Project">
  
You can create a new project by clicking the **Add New Project** button on the dashboard.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="existing-project" label="Existing Project">

Already have a project? Simply choose your existing project from the list on the dashboard.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create a New Web Application

Create a new **Web** application from the **Your Apps** section in the Particle dashboard.

### Retrieve the Project ID, Client Key, and Application ID

Follow these steps to retrieve your credentials:

1. Navigate to the **Project Information** section in your dashboard.
   - Here, you'll find both your `projectId` and `clientKey`.
2. Go to the **Your Apps** section.
   - Locate the web application you just created (or an existing one), and find the `appId` listed under the app's details.

:::note
For a quick overview of the Particle dashboard, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7DYCMNDmjo&ab_channel=ParticleNetwork) or check out the [Dashboard Quickstart Guide](/guides/dashboard).
:::

After obtaining your `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId`, you'll need to use these to configure the `ConnectKitProvider` component from `@particle-network/connectkit`. 

The boilerplate already includes the basic variable setupâ€”just add your API keys to the `.env.sample` file and rename it to `.env`.

:::tip
At this point, you're ready to either run and test the application or begin development through `app/page.tsx`.

Weâ€™ll also go over some of the granular controls available through `ConnectKitProvider`.
:::

### Configuring ConnectKitProvider

When working with `ConnectKitProvider`, it's recommended to use a dedicated `Connectkit.tsx` file in the `src` directory where you can configure and export the component. Then, you'll use this export to wrap your main App component (the location of your Particle Connect implementation through `ConnectButton`).

Hereâ€™s how you can configure `ConnectKitProvider`:

**Required Configurations:**
- `projectId`, `clientKey`, and `appId` â€” Get these from the [Particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network).
- `chains` â€” Specify the supported chains for your dApp (this is an array of Viem-originating chain objects imported from `@particle-network/connectkit/chains`).
- `walletConnectors` â€” Define the wallets you want to support.

**Optional Configurations:**
- `theme` and `language` for basic customization of the connection modal UI.
- Additional appearance customizations.

:::note
In the boilerplate application, you'll find a pre-configured `Connectkit.tsx` file located in the `src` directory.
:::

Below is an example of a **configured** instance of `ConnectKitProvider`. For more details around each available property, head over to the [Particle Connect Web SDK reference](/api-reference/connect/desktop/web).

In this example, we import the `fuse` and `fuseSparknet` networks from `"@particle-network/connectkit/chains"`, and then add them to the `chains` array inside the `plugins` object.

```tsx

"use client";

// Particle imports
import { ConnectKitProvider, createConfig } from '@particle-network/connectkit';
import { authWalletConnectors } from '@particle-network/connectkit/auth';
import { evmWalletConnectors } from '@particle-network/connectkit/evm';
import { solanaWalletConnectors } from '@particle-network/connectkit/solana';
import { EntryPosition, wallet } from '@particle-network/connectkit/wallet';

import { fuse, fuseSparknet } from "@particle-network/connectkit/chains"; // Chains are imported here
import { aa } from "@particle-network/connectkit/aa"; // Account Abstraction packages
import React from 'react';

const config = createConfig({
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID!,
  clientKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID!,

  appearance: {
    recommendedWallets: [
      { walletId: 'metaMask', label: 'Recommended' },
      { walletId: 'coinbaseWallet', label: 'popular' },
    ],
    language: 'en-US',
    mode: "auto", // dark or auto.
  },
  
  walletConnectors: [
    evmWalletConnectors({
      // Replace this with your app metadata.
      metadata: {
        name: 'Connectkit Demo',
        icon: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? `${window.location.origin}/favicon.ico` : '',
        description: 'Particle Connectkit Next.js Scaffold.',
        url: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.origin : '',
      },
      walletConnectProjectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID as string,
    }),
    
    authWalletConnectors({
      authTypes: ['email', 'google', 'twitter', 'github'], // Optional, restricts the types of social logins supported
    }),
  ],
  
  plugins: [
    wallet({
      visible: true,
      entryPosition: EntryPosition.BR, // Use BR (bottom right), BL (bottom left), TR (top right), TL (top left) to move the wallet entry position
    }),

    // aa config start
    aa({
      name: "SIMPLE",
      version: "2.0.0",
    }),
    // aa config end
  ],
  
  // List the chains you want to include
  chains: [fuse, fuseSparknet],
});

// Wrap your application with this exported component, or ConnectKitProvider directly.
export const ParticleConnectkit = ({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren) => {
  return <ConnectKitProvider config={config}>{children}</ConnectKitProvider>;
};
```

:::

### Wrapping Your Application with ConnectKitProvider

Wrap your primary application component (wherever you place and use `ConnectButton` alongside the various hooks from Particle Connect) with the `ParticleConnectKit` component (exported from `ConnectKitProvider`).

:::note
In the boilerplate application, you'll find a pre-configured `layout.tsx` file located in the `app` directory.
:::

Hereâ€™s an example of what this looks like for a `layout.tsx` file:

```tsx layout.tsx
import { ParticleConnectkit } from '@/connectkit'; // Export of a configured ConnectKitProvider instance
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
import './globals.css';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Particle Connectkit App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <ParticleConnectkit>{children}</ParticleConnectkit>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Facilitating Logins and Chain Interactions

With **Particle Connect** now configured, you can proceed to enable social logins within your application through the aforementioned `ConnectButton` component.

Additionally, for driving application-level interaction (after initial onboarding), `@particle-network/connectkit` provides a variety of hooks. You can explore all available hooks in the [Particle Connect SDK documentation](/api-reference/connect/desktop/web#key-react-hooks-for-particle-connect).

:::note
The boilerplate application includes a basic example featuring only a **Connect** button (`ConnectButton`).
:::

After logging in (connecting), users can access the embedded wallet modal provided by **Particle Connect** via the button in the bottom right corner, unless customized through the `wallet` configuration within `ConnectKitProvider`.

Find an example of additional features like fetching and displaying user information, balances, on-ramp services, and sending transactions using either the native Particle Provider (Viem-based WalletClient) or ethers.js through an EIP-1193 provider from the [page.tsx](https://github.com/Particle-Network/particle-connectkit2.0-quickstart/blob/main/particle-connect/src/app/page.tsx) file in the demo repository.
