# Oracles

Blockchain oracles are third-party services that provide data to smart contracts running on a blockchain network. Oracles act as intermediaries between the blockchain network and the outside world, enabling smart contracts to execute based on real-world events or data.

## SupraOracles

[Supra](https://supra.com) is a novel, high-throughput Oracle & IntraLayer: A vertically integrated toolkit of cross-chain solutions (data oracles, asset bridges, automation network, and more) that interlink all blockchains, public (L1s and L2s) or private (enterprises).

Supra’s distributed Verifiable Random Function (dVRF) solution provides unbiased, unpredictable, and provably fair randomness for blockchain gaming and casinoFi use-cases such as loot boxes, NFT-minting, character upgrades, odds-based games, and on-chain lotteries. Supra’s dVRF design uses a novel non-interactive Distributed Key Generation (NI-DKG), allowing it to be very low-latency and cryptographically secure. Supra’s dVRF paper was accepted into ACM CCS 2023, a top cybersecurity conference.

## DIA

DIA is a blockchain project that provides decentralized oracles for financial and economic data. DIA's oracles enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that require real-time, high-quality financial data, without the need for a centralized data provider. Read more about DIA on their [website](https://www.diadata.org/) and [documentation](https://docs.diadata.org/).

Check the list of [price feeds](https://docs.diadata.org/documentation/oracle-documentation/deployed-contracts#fuse) available on the Fuse Network.

## Chainlink

A centralized version on Chainlink data feeds will be launched soon.
