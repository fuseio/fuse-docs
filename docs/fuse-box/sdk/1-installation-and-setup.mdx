## Installation

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="sdk"
	activeOptions={["web","flutter"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="web">

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk
```

</PlatformTabItem>

<PlatformTabItem value="flutter">

Install the FuseSDK using Dart or flutter.

```dart
dart pub add fuse_wallet_sdk
```

```dart
flutter pub add fuse_wallet_sdk
```

</PlatformTabItem>
</PlatformTabs>

Once you have installed the package, you can import it into your code:

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="sdk"
	activeOptions={["web","flutter"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="web">

```typescript
import { FuseSDK } from "@fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk";
```

</PlatformTabItem>

<PlatformTabItem value="flutter">

```dart
import 'package:fuse_wallet_sdk/fuse_wallet_sdk.dart';
```

</PlatformTabItem>
</PlatformTabs>

### Usage

To use the SDK in your project, you must create an instance of the **`FuseSDK`** class. This class is the key to interacting with the Fuse API using the SDK. Fortunately, the `FuseSDK` class provides a range of instance methods, allowing you to execute various operations with the API.

Whether you aim to fetch or create a smart wallet, relay an ERC20/FUSE transfer, relay an ERC721 transfer, relay a generic transaction, swap tokens, or stake tokens, the `FuseSDK` class has you covered. Additionally, the SDK provides data features that allow you to get the list of tokens owned by an address, get token details, and get a smart wallet's token balance.

The following code initializes the Fuse SDK and creates an instance of the `FuseSDK` class. The `apiKey` variable should be set to your own API key.

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="sdk"
	activeOptions={["web","flutter"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="web">

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { FuseSDK } from '@fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk';

const apiKey = 'API_KEY';
const credentials = new ethers.Wallet("PRIVATE_KEY");
const fuse = await FuseSDK.init(apiKey, credentials);
```

</PlatformTabItem>

<PlatformTabItem value="flutter">

```dart
import 'package:fuse_wallet_sdk/fuse_wallet_sdk.dart';

final apiKey = 'API_KEY';
final privateKey = EthPrivateKey.fromHex('YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY');
final fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(apiKey, privateKey);
```

</PlatformTabItem>
</PlatformTabs>

Once you have created an instance of the `FuseSDK` class, you can use its instance methods to interact with the Fuse API. In the following section, we will cover the available methods of the SDK.
