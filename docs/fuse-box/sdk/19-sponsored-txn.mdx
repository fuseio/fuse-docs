### Sponsored Transactions

Sponsored transactions are the ability to pay for another userâ€™s transaction fees. To do this, the Fuse operator must enable the sponsored feature in his project and deposit some funds into the paymaster contract. The SDK provides a middleware to check if the project is sponsored and the amount of funds available for sponsoring.

To use this feature, you must first initialize the SDK with the `withPaymaster` parameter set to `true`.

```typescript
import { FuseSDK } from "@fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk";

const apiKey = "API_KEY";
const fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(apiKey, credentials, {
  withPaymaster: true,
});
```

</PlatformTabItem>

<PlatformTabItem value="flutter">

```dart
import 'package:fuse_wallet_sdk/fuse_wallet_sdk.dart';
final apiKey = 'API_KEY';
final privateKey = EthPrivateKey.fromHex('YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY');
final fuseSDK = await FuseSDK.init(apiKey, privateKey, withPaymaster: true);
```
